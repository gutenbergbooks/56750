<h2 id="PUBLISHERS_NOTE">PUBLISHERS’ NOTE</h2>

<p>This remarkable historical romance is closely associated by the
author in his brief Preface with the early Second Coming of
Christ, a belief that is held to-day by a rapidly increasing number
of people in all parts of Christendom.</p>

<p>The story was first published in 1827, and was issued at different
times under different titles, as “Salathiel, a Story of the Past,
the Present, and the Future”; and “Salathiel, the Immortal,
or the Wandering Jew.” It had wide popularity for a generation
or more, the leading critical journals in England and
America giving it great praise.</p>

<p>In the present revival of the story, many typographical, and
some other errors, that crept into the various editions, have been
carefully corrected, chapter and marginal headings have been
added, and the dialogs have been generally broken up into paragraphs
in harmony with the fashion of to-day, and the whole
book has been carefully annotated.</p>

<p>We are glad in the belief that we have carried out successfully
General Lewis Wallace’s wish, that the story be worthily illustrated.
We were fortunate in securing a masterful artist who
shared the great enthusiasm of the author of “Ben Hur” for this
story of Croly’s, and in his drawings Mr. de Thulstrup has spared
neither time nor labor, spending many months, both here and in
Europe, in the study of the details necessary to perfect the pictures.
We feel assured that General Wallace will now wish to
recast the closing sentence of his Introductory Letter.</p>

<p>The words that doomed Salathiel to immortality on earth,
“Tarry Thou Till I Come,” so fit the story that we have ventured
to make them the chief title, and have so combined the
new with the old that no one will be misled. The colored
frontispiece by Mr. de Thulstrup happily illustrates the new title.</p>

<p>In the Appendix will be found a series of letters written for
this publication by thirty or more representative Jewish scholars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
on “<cite>Jesus of Nazareth from the Present Jewish Point of View</cite>.”
The Appendix contains other matter suggested by the legend of
“The Wandering Jew,” prepared by D. S. Gregory, LL.D., and
by Arthur T. Pierson, D.D. The general <span class="smcap">Introduction</span> is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>It is believed that no book now before the public can be made
nearly so helpful as this one in interesting the minds of readers,
young and old, in the events that closely followed in Palestine
the Crucifixion, and marked the conflict between early Judaism
and Christianity, and ended in the final destruction of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The reader will now and then be reminded of some of the
more striking passages in two or three of the popular religious
novels published in the past decade. But, as it is not given
even to great geniuses to remember <em>forward</em>, our author will
scarcely be exposed to the accusation of having borrowed from
these later writers.</p>

<p class="by"><i>From General Lewis Wallace</i><br />
<span class="smaller">(Author of “Ben Hur”)</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Crawfordsville, Ind.</span>, <i>September 1, 1900</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: I have learned that you have in mind the issuance
of a new edition of Croly’s story of “The Wandering
Jew.” Perhaps you will lend a willing ear to a suggestion or
two, so much is the book in my love.</p>

<p>In my judgment, the six greatest English novels are “Ivanhoe,”
“The Last of the Barons,” “The Tale of Two Cities,”
“Jane Eyre,” “Hypatia,” and this romance of Croly’s. If
Shakespeare had never been born; if Milton, Byron, and
Tennyson were singers to be, and Bacon, Darwin, and Ruskin
unknown; if there had been no British dramatists, no British
historians, no works in British libraries significant of British
science and philosophy, no alcoves glutted with bookish remains
of British moralists and preachers, still the six works
named would of themselves suffice to constitute a British
literature.</p>

<p>This is bold, I know: bold in assertion, and even bolder in
the lift of Croly’s story from the ground to a place in the
upper sky. Can I justify the classification? Certainly, if
only your patience and my time permitted.</p>

<p>Here, to begin, is a broad adverse generality,—the very
worst of possible arguments against the book is, that of the
five great classics with which I have thrust it into association,
it is the least known to-day by the general public.
Yet the admission is not in the least decisive of merits; in inquisitorial
phrase it serves merely to put objections to question.</p>

<p>It is a religious novel, says one, sneering. That used to
be urged against the “Pilgrim’s Progress”; yet the Pilgrim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
goes marching on, and I fancy his progress will stop only
when the world stops. And how is it that of late years,
at least, several novels religious in tone and spirit have been
more than well received? Indeed, is it not a fact that some
of them have attained extraordinary popularity, thus gainsaying
the narrow Puritanism which less than a century ago
put the novel under ban, regardless of kind and excellence?</p>

<p>Another objection. The style is somewhat too exalted;
and then the critic makes haste to stretch the alleged defect
to the author’s want of art. Now, I would not like to be
dogmatic or unkind, but such points certainly disclose a lamentable
comprehension. Why, coiled up in that objection
lie the very excellencies of the book. How, pray, could exaltation
be avoided? Who does not know that in description
the sublime always imposes its own laws? Imagine, if you
can, the commonplace used by a narrator struggling to convey
an idea of the tremendous in a hurricane at sea.</p>

<p>And as to a want of art, I would like to say mildly that
the absence of art in the book is its main charm. Any, the
slightest show of premeditation or design would have been
gross treason to nature. Does a woman, struck to the heart,
utter her grief by measure as a singer sings or a poet writes?
And how is it with a man in rage or pain? Yet, verily, there
was never a woman or a man in speech so impelled by a sting
of soul as Salathiel.</p>

<p>Passing, now, the matter of criticism and mere negative
dealing, I choose to be affirmative. Salathiel, the subject of
the book, was a Jew, and in rank a Prince of the Tribe of
Naphtali. In the persecution of Christ, his arrest, his trial,
his scourging, Salathiel was the leading insatiate; and such,
doubtless, he would have continued down to the last minute
of the third hour of the Crucifixion but that the victim
stopped him. At what stage of the awful crime the stoppage
took place, the author leaves to inference; but how the incident
befell and its almost inconceivable effect upon Salathiel,
no man should again try to describe. This is from Croly, his
words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But in the moment of exultation I was stricken. He
who had refused an hour of life to the victim was, in terrible
retribution, condemned to know the misery of life interminable.
I heard through all the voices of Jerusalem—I should
have heard through all the thunders of heaven—the calm,
low voice, ‘Tarry thou till I come!’”</p>

</div>

<p>Such the retribution; now the effect.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I felt my fate at once! I sprang away through the shouting
hosts as if the avenging angel waved his sword above my
head. Wild songs, furious execrations, the uproar of myriads
stirred to the heights of passion, filled the air; still, through
all, I heard the pursuing sentence, ‘Tarry thou till I come,’
and felt it to be the sentence of incurable agony! I was
never to know the shelter of the grave!”</p>

</div>

<p>And then follow five paragraphs, each beginning with the
same words uttered, as I imagine, in the tone of a shriek of
anguish, “Immortality on earth!” And of those paragraphs,
regarded as a dissection of the moral part of a man by virtue
of which he is susceptible of infinite happiness or infinite
misery, I say that for completeness and eloquence they are
without parallel in the language. Nor is that all. In those
paragraphs, one reading will find the definition of a punishment
which in subtlety, in torture, and in duration is as far
out of range of human origin as in execution it is out of range
of human power. Yet more. Instantly with the comprehension
of the punishment defined, the immeasurable difference
between the agonies of death on a cross, though of days in
duration, and the agonies of immortal life under curse on earth,
becomes discernible. In that difference there is a divine
thought in anger, an avenging impulse. The superiority in
misery of the punishment of Salathiel, its term of sentence,
its depth of suffering, its superhuman passion of vengeance,
seem impossible to the all-patient Christ; and while we are
considering its possibility, the book carries us to the question,
Is there a wandering Jew?</p>

<p>I think so. Let smile now who will; yet, as I see, a whole
race is the multiple of the man, just as the man is the incarnation
of the race. Israel, the plural, merges in Salathiel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the singular, insomuch that to think of the one is to think of
the other. In this instance, also, the similitudes become creative,
and life, nature, history, and doom, sinking the race,
make room for the wandering Jew.</p>

<p>Not only do I think there is a wandering Jew, but I know
him intimately. To Croly he was a young man, a warrior;
to me, he came an old man, a philosopher. Croly beheld him
irate, passionate, vengeful. I saw him wiser by many hundreds
of years, and repentant, and trying vainly to bring
about a brotherhood of man by preaching the unity of God.
With Croly, he was the Prince of Naphtali; with me, he was
the Prince of India.</p>

<p>Returning now—with such a subject, dealt with so magnificently,
I can not see how the great reading public in America
can be indifferent to a new edition of Croly’s romance. Only
take us into your faith, gentlemen, and see to it that the issue
be worthy the theme. Be even luxurious with it; give it fine
paper, wide margins, large type, and choice binding; and, if
Gustave Doré were living, I would further beg you to have
the edition illustrated by him.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>“Tarry thou till I come.” These words smote Salathiel
like successive thunder-claps, tho uttered without the noise
of speech. At once a doom and a prophecy—this Jesus, now
climbing Calvary to His death, would come again, and the
Jew could not perish from the earth until His coming!</p>

<p>Our author, Dr. Croly, has based his story on this old, pathetic
legend. He believed that “The Wandering Jew”—typical
of the Jewish race—is about to end his wearisome
journeyings, as Christ is soon to come.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>That the Christ is coming, and that this coming is near at
hand, is believed to-day by millions.</p>

<p>He is coming—but how?</p>

<p>Hear Him:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman
hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened—the
life and nature of the leaven reappearing in the quickened
mass.</p>

<p>Again: The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard-seed,
the least of all seeds, so little that it is likely to be lost
sight of in the count of forces; but it has life in it, and the
power to grow and multiply, and it spreads its branches in
every direction, each laden with seeds—the life and nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the first grain reappearing in every one of the myriads of
grains.</p>

<p>And again: The kingdom of heaven is as if a man should
cast seed into the ground; and it should spring and grow up,
he knoweth not how; first the blade, then the ear, after that
the full corn in the ear. It is all natural: the earth does its
work; the sun, the air, the water do their work, and the life
and nature of the seed grow and multiply, reappearing in each
grain in exact accordance with the nature of the seed. It is
natural, but marvelous: the man “knoweth not how” it is
done; but no one says, therefore, that that growth is supernatural,
miraculous.</p>

</div>

<p>Whence the germ of life in the seed? Whence the germ of
life in the kingdom of heaven? Who can tell? The wind
bloweth where it listeth. Thou seest the effect of it, but
canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth. So is
life wherever you find it, whether at the birth of a yeast-plant,
of grains of mustard-seed and of corn, or of the natural
and spiritual man. But the leaven, and the grains of mustard-seed
and of corn, and the kingdoms of the natural and the
spiritual man grow and reach perfection by natural processes—that
is, in harmony with cause and effect—each process
subject to critical and scientific analysis, if that analysis goes
deep enough, and wide enough, and far enough.</p>

<p>Life reappears in new life. The leaven and the seed and
the Christ-life all reincarnate themselves in more leaven, more
seed, more of the Christ life. “In that day,” said Jesus, “ye
shall know that I am <em>in</em> you.” Those who study the New
Testament can not but be impressed with how often, and under
how many forms, is there uttered the thought, <em>Christ formed
in you</em>.</p>

<p class="tb">This is <em>the</em> coming of Christ. Not that it is the <em>only</em> coming;
many millions of earnest men and women believe that in
the near future He will come in a way palpable to our physical
senses as He came nineteen hundred years ago. “Ye men
of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same
Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in
like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven” (Acts i. 11).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet experiences on the physical plane are of little comparative
value—<em>comparative</em>. Jesus bade the doubting Thomas to
reach forth his hand and touch Him, that he might have tangible
evidence: Now, Thomas, you believe because you have
seen and felt; but blessed is he who believes on the higher
plane of spiritual knowing. It is “an evil and adulterous
generation” that seeketh after proofs of spiritual things on
the sensuous level. Men saw and touched Jesus in Palestine
who were millions of miles from Him. Were Christ to appear
in visible form, it might easily be of no value whatever
to come into physical contact with Him, to meet Him on
Broadway or on the Strand; but who can measure the value
of having Christ recreated in himself, as the leaven is recreated
in the meal, and as a seed is recreated in new seed, so that
men, when they see that man, and talk to him, and deal with
him, shall feel that they have been with Christ?</p>

<p>One day I saw in a neighbor’s flower-bed a little plant, that,
as it pushed its way above the ground, had brought with it
the mother seed from which it grew. That was a literal
reappearance of the planted seed; but it was not <em>the</em> reappearance,
not <em>the</em> resurrection of the seed, for which a seed
grows.</p>

<p>Christ came the first time into men’s vision by coming on
the plane of their senses; He comes the second time into men’s
vision by lifting them up to His plane of spiritual comprehension.</p>

<p class="tb">This coming of Christ involves a new birth, a new creation,
a new kingdom. It means a new step in the evolution of
man. As man has stepped from the mineral kingdom to the
vegetable kingdom, and from the vegetable kingdom to the
animal kingdom, and from the animal kingdom to the kingdom
of the natural man,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> so now he steps from the kingdom
of the natural man to the kingdom of the spiritual man, every
portion of this step a natural process subject to critical scientific
analysis, if that analysis goes deep enough, wide enough,
far enough. It is the continuance of evolution without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
break, without a leap (“Nature never makes leaps,” says
Leibnitz; the leaps are only seeming), lifting the race by a
new birth through Christ the type-life up to the plane of
spiritual being and knowing.</p>

<p class="tb">Is the visible second coming of Jesus fancy or truth? Our
author believed it true, and increasing multitudes to-day believe
it true. Among these are many of the foremost Christian
teachers of this generation, as that trio of great preachers
recently dead, Charles H. Spurgeon, A. J. Gordon, and
Dwight L. Moody; Newman Hall, Theodore Monod, Arthur
T. Pierson, F. B. Meyer, J. H. Brookes, C. Cuthbert Hall.
There is evidently near at hand an extraordinary revival of
this belief.</p>

<p class="tb">In the republication of this remarkable story about the Jew
who is “to wander on earth until Christ comes again,” it has
seemed to me that it would not be inappropriate to give, by
way of Introduction, and in the Appendix, several lines of
thought bearing upon the coming of Christ.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Essential Coming of Christ</span></h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>This coming is in harmony with the laws of sequence and
continuity.</p>

<p>In each preceding step in the evolution of man the unfolding
of the <em>physical basis</em> of life was from below, but the <em>life</em>
itself was from above, never from below. Scientists are now
practically unanimous in saying that, “There is not a scintilla
of evidence that the inorganic or mineral world has ever
evolved a plant life.” “To the scientist,” says Darwin, “it
is a hopeless inquiry as to how life originated.” “Life from
an egg,” is still the latest dictum of science; that is, life only
from life.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Each of the successive steps or kingdoms has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
its type-life. The plant—that is, the physical basis of the
plant life—came from the inorganic matter; the animal—that
is, the physical basis of the animal life—came from the plant
and through the plant from the mineral kingdom; the natural
man—that is, the physical basis of the life of the natural
man—came from the animal and the kingdoms below it; the
spiritual man—that is, the physical basis of the life of the
spiritual man—comes from the natural man and the kingdoms
below him.</p>

<p>The development from kingdom to kingdom was a natural
unfolding; yet the new creature of the next higher order always
came through a new birth—a double birth: (1) the
birth of the new type-life of the next higher kingdom into the
evolutionary order of nature, through the hereditary chain;
and (2) the birth of each individual into this type-life.</p>

<p class="tb">None of the previous transitions from a lower to a higher
kingdom has taken place within historic times. The cradle at
Bethlehem flashes a searchlight down the spiral stairway up
which man has come from platform to platform, kingdom to
kingdom. Here at last we see that the type-life of the kingdom
of the spiritual man is born from above into the hereditary
chain of evolution. Many times, and in many ways,
He declares I am “from above.” He is born a natural man,
and yet possesses the life of the kingdom next higher, and
proceeds to lift the natural man by a new birth into the kingdom
of the spiritual man. He is born the son of man and
the son of God, bridging the chasm with His own being.</p>

<p>Again and again He says, “I am the <em>life</em>”; “I have come
that ye may have <em>life</em>”; except ye partake of Me “ye have no
<em>life</em> in you.” He calls Himself the “bread of <em>life</em>,” “the water
of <em>life</em>.” This would all be meaningless were Christ talking
about the life of the kingdom of the natural man which all now
have and have had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>As the spiritual type-life lifts the natural man into the spiritual
kingdom, so the type-life of the natural man lifted the
animal into the kingdom of the natural man, and the animal
type-life lifted the vegetable, and the vegetable type-life lifted
the mineral.</p>

<p>There is no break in the golden thread that runs through
all this series of development from the mineral world up to
the new creature in Christ Jesus. There is nothing in this
last development contrary to nature; it follows along exactly
the same laws of natural unfoldment as did the other
kingdoms. The law of continuity holds.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> Christ is born
really into the kingdom of the natural man, and the natural
man is born into the spiritual kingdom, through Christ, the
type-life. In this last stage of man’s ascent, as in the
previous ones, nature makes “no leap.” Think not, says
Christ, “that I have come to destroy the law; I have not
come to destroy, but to fulfil”; I have come to carry on My
work in harmony with the processes of the universe. What
is law but the method that the immanent God, everywhere
and forever, pursues in His work? True, segments of the
circle He follows are easily out of the reach of our vision.
Huxley tells us that he has no doubt that even on the physical
plane, most important work is being done far beyond the
reach of the most powerful microscope. He might have said,
and kept easily within bounds, <em>the</em> most important work.</p>

<p>The crystal is matter plus the principle of crystallization;
so the plant, the animal, the natural man—always the creature
of the kingdom below with the plus sign, for a birth is an
unfoldment and <em>something more</em>. And so, the Christ life takes
the character, the soul, the spirit of the natural man, which
have developed through the ages—takes them through a new
birth, this time with man’s consent. “Marvel not that I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
unto you, ye must be born again.” “Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, except a man be born from above he can not see the
kingdom of God” (John iii. 3). Ye are “babes in Christ,”
“Ye are new creatures.” We become heirs “of God through
Christ,” crying “Abba, Father.” “In love’s hour Eternal Love
conceives in us the child of God” through the spiritual type-life
Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class="tb">Christ could not have been more explicit or more scientifically
exact in declaring Himself the type-life of the spiritual
man. “I am the door,” “the way,” “the life”; “no man
can come to the Father but by Me.” “He that hath the Son
hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life”;
he may be a Cæsar leading armies against Pompey, or a
Cicero declaiming his matchless orations against Cataline, and
yet be <em>dead</em>.</p>

<p>In the inspired picture-history of creation, an Adam is the
type-life of the kingdom of the natural man; in the New Testament,
Christ is presented in every way as the type-life of
the kingdom of the spiritual man. “The first man Adam was
made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening
spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that
which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual” (1
Cor. xv. 45, 46).</p>

<p class="tb">Here, also, the law of conformity to type is manifest.
Each type-life is perfect, but those who are born through the
type-life begin at the bottom; the “fall” is great from the
type-life to the beginning of growth in the next higher kingdom.
But from that onward the battle of evolution is to secure
likeness to the type. “We all, with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, <em>are changed into the same
image</em> from glory to glory” (2 Cor. iii. 18). We shall be
“conformed to the <em>image of His Son</em>” (Rom. viii. 29). “As
we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the
<em>image of the heavenly</em>” (1 Cor. xv. 49). After the night is
over we shall awake in His likeness.</p>

<p>Newton said that he made a splendid guess at the universal
law of gravitation when he saw the apple fall. Why may it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
not be permissible for us to guess, from the law of conformity
to type, that in every kingdom the new creature carries with it
the pattern of its type-life, and that after this pattern, in the
lower kingdoms, the accompanying cells strive to weave a nature
corresponding with its kingdom, and in the kingdom of
the spiritual man the Holy Spirit strives to weave the nature
of the spiritual man?<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>In the lower kingdoms it is a survival of the <em>fightest</em>, in the
highest a survival of the fittest, the struggle for life for ourselves
merging into a <em>struggle for life for others</em>. Even among
men in the earlier days, to discover the greatest man, the
measuring-string was placed around the muscle. That was
the age of Hercules. Then the time came when the measuring-string
was placed around the head. That was the age of
Bacon and Shakespeare. But the time comes in the rapidly
advancing future when the measuring-string will be placed
around the heart, and he who measures most there will be
most conformed to the Master, for he is greatest who most
fully gives himself for others.</p>

<p class="tb">Evolution goes on, hereafter, in the inner and upper world,
outside and beyond our vision, making many and many variations
doubtless, as in the lower realms. In the Father’s spiritual
house also are many mansions. We are stepping from
the physiological to the psychological, from body and mind
to spirit. As in all previous growth, the latest type-life is
reappearing in His generation—in the “new creatures” of His
kingdom.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>The outward evolution—that of the physical—marvelous beyond
thought, is comparatively insignificant. The chief evolution
has been and is within. The scientist is unscientific who
ignores the greater evolution and builds his explanatory system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
on the lesser—on the least. Psychology is also a science.
Has nature one method for the development of the physical
part of man’s being, and another for the development of the
non-material and spiritual? Nature is not divided. What
means the hereditary likeness, mental and spiritual—not less
marked than the physical? These marks often skip many
generations and then reappear again in full. They can not,
therefore, be the result of education or imitation. Nor is it
easy to believe that they were placed within us by a direct act
of creation, as the old-fashioned theological professor taught
that God mixed the fossils with the plastic stones at creation,
somewhat as a cook mixes raisins and other fruits in the dough
for her plum-pudding.</p>

<p>What means the gradual development in the brain of the
cerebrum and cerebellum, the organs of the soul powers, enlarging
from generation to generation? These are scarcely
visible in the lowest animals. They become larger as we advance
up the animal scale of intelligence, or psychic power;
large in the ape, who came far along the same line that man
came; four times as large in the lowest Zulu as in the ape,
but far larger in the European and American civilized man—thus
slowly made perfect through awful struggles and sufferings,
painfully growing a million years or more. Is it not
then reasonable to believe that there is a corresponding psychic
or soul development from generation to generation in the
unseen individuality, the ego, which uses the cerebrum and
cerebellum as organs; that up the spiral stairway of evolution
the whole man has come,—his personality, with its soul
powers, and the physical organs of these powers in the brain,
and the entire physical man?</p>

<p>To-day, in the unfolding embryo of every child, nature marvelously
and clearly retells the history of the evolution of the
physical nature of the human race from the one-celled moneron
to the billion-celled man. For the embryo of the child
is a historic map, done in flesh and blood, of the evolution of
man, of the forms he has assumed, broadly speaking, as he
climbed nature’s stairway.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>Is it hard to believe that our individuality has been born
and reborn through the line of ancestry back to the type-lives,
and through them back to the “beginning,” when God took
of His own life to develop, through ages of conflict, personalities
other than His own who would, of their own free will,
choose goodness? Is it hard to believe that at every successive
birth each parent has placed his stamp upon the individuality,
but that the individuality has perdured being reborn again and
again into successive higher kingdoms? Does it seem hard to
believe that we should be born many times? Is it then harder
to believe that we should be born <em>after</em> we have lived than
that we should be born when we have not lived? The profoundest
mystery is in the first birth, in which we all believe.
And why should it be thought by us incredible that, with the
mingling of the parental cells, the individuality exactly fitted
should be reborn in the line of heredity, receiving the parental
stamp, being attracted by the law which answers to that law
which guides the atom unerringly to its place in the crystal—that
same law wonderfully exalted? Whatever and wherever
character is, it must be obedient to the law that draws it,
for the law of attraction is even more irresistible in the inner
world than is the law of gravitation in the outer world. Every
man as he comes to his birth comes to his own place; in a
profound sense he <em>chooses</em> his parents and his surroundings.
As he was, he is, plus his birth-gain and his growth through
consent and volition; his past leads him.</p>

<p>And in this last transition each man is conscious that his
individuality continues, altho he passes from one kingdom
into the next. The dictum of science is “no leap, no break”—continuity.
Then it is reasonable to believe that the individuality
will continue through succeeding future changes, as
it has continued these millions of years through the successive
past changes. It would require much credulity to believe that
nature has travailed in pain these untold ages to develop a
personality that would of its own free will choose goodness,
only to destroy that personality as soon as made. John Fiske<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
has well said:<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> “The materialistic assumption that the life of
the soul ends with the life of the body, is perhaps the most
colossal instance of assumption that is known in the history
of philosophy.”</p>

<p>That was a provincial notion about the universe which was
held before Copernicus’s time—the belief that the sun, planets,
stars, all revolved around the earth. Copernicus was called
the destroyer of faith and bitterly denounced. His idea
made the earth but a speck, and the Milky Way—billions of
miles long—the mere yard-stick of the universe. All this
has immensely enlarged faith—did not destroy it. Darwin,
too, was called the destroyer of faith; but now we begin to
see that evolution, in giving man countless eons of growth, instead
of keeping him a creature of yesterday, bounded by the
cradle and grave, has immensely enlarged faith, and beyond
thought has added to the dignity of man.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>At each succeeding birth the individuality, to thrive, must
be in harmony with its changed surroundings, and the cells
that swarm in every organized body struggle to bring this to
pass. It is the business of the cell to obey the pushings of
the governing force in the organization to which it belongs.
The plant needs water, minerals, air, sunshine. Its attendant
cells hear the cry of their master and build roots into the
ground and branches into the air, and weave leaves into lungs
and laboratories. Note a vine in some cave—how it works
its way toward the hole through which sunshine is streaming,
and how it causes some roots to build out toward a vein of
water; others toward a skeleton many feet away and along the
bones of that skeleton—hungering and thirsting for minerals,
water, light, heat. Hungering and thirsting—asking, knocking—the
plant receives. Seek and ye shall find; strive and
it shall be yours. This is the law in the plant life, the law
in the animal life, in the life of the natural man, in the life
of the spiritual man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>In a deep sense, as a man thinketh so he is. The universe
of cells within each man calls him “master.” Ye are gods;
kings upon thrones; your slightest wish is heard; your earnest,
persistent desire compels obedience. Answer to prayer is a
growth, a building up or down to what you wish. Wishing
is asking. Ask what you will, and from that instant receiving,
you receive.</p>

<p>Christ can never <em>fully</em> come into a man until the man has
grown up to the level of spiritual things. It is a sensuous
generation that seeks to be satisfied with consolation through
the physical senses.</p>

<p class="tb">All of our faculties carry their own demonstrations of truth
up to the level of their development. To the pure and loving,
purity and love need no witnesses. Every man has had placed
in his hand a latch-key to the beauty and wisdom—to all of the
excellences of the universe; but there is only one way of using
that latch-key effectively. We must grow to a level with the
latch. I must have an eye fitted for the landscape, and must
have a poetic soul before the landscape can read its poetry to
me. I may believe that Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony is
music because a master of music has told me so; that is belief
based on authority; or, I may measure the waves of sound
and scientifically demonstrate that it is music; but such
evidences are beggarly, and praise based on them would drive
a composer mad. But let me hunger and thirst after music;
seek, pray for musical sight and soul until I develop up to the
level of Beethoven’s Symphony; then as quickly as I hear it
I exclaim: “That is music!” Do you ask: “Who told you?”
I answer: “No one; I <em>know</em> it!” My latch-key enters, for I
am on a level with the latch. I asked, I sought, I knocked,
until I grew up into the musical world. I must grow up to
God before I can know Him; I must grow up to Christ before
I can see Him. The pure in heart shall see and hear spiritual
things. I must be on God’s level before even the lowly flower
can tell me the thought that was in His mind when He
created it.</p>

<p>Seek is the law of growth in all kingdoms; and it is the
law of development and of the adjustment of the feeders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
through which each kingdom asserts itself to its creatures and
gives them their food and consolation. Who has not smiled
many times at the serio-humorous reflection of Robert Louis
Stevenson on hearing of the death of Matthew Arnold: “So,
Arnold is dead! I am sorry; he won’t like God.” There is
a profoundly solemn truth under this witticism.</p>

<p>There is health for the plant in sun-rays; the plant had
the need of light, and its cells heard the cry and groped
toward the light. That capacity for light and that groping
of the cells proved the existence of the sun. The conscious
feeling after God among people everywhere proves the existence
of God and of the spiritual world.</p>

<p class="tb">The new-born child must adjust its lungs to the atmosphere
into which it comes or it must die. It hereafter must eat and
drink with its mouth, breathe with its lungs; it must have new
feeders. The bird, as it chips its way out of the egg, adjusts
itself to its new surroundings. It is a hard trial often for a
child to be weaned, yet it is love that does it. It is done to
give it more abundant life, not less.</p>

<p>This is the meaning of self-denial, fasting, repentance,
suffering—the weaning of the feeders from the old to the new
environment—the feeders that give food and consolation. We
enter into the kingdom of the spiritual man as the babe enters
into the kingdom of the natural man. Every new creature
grows up from the grave of the old. Up the stairs of holy
patience we climb the heights of the inner kingdom. Our
will henceforth is to yield our will, but the sensuous man contests
every inch with the spiritual. The perishing of the old
man day by day is painful, and so is the renewal of the inner,
for birth also is painful. We learn to love love, hate hate,
and fear only fear; but every move upward has in it birth-pangs.
We are in the soul’s gymnasium—on its battle-field.
The creature was made subject to vanity for a cause.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> Says
Ruskin: “I do not wonder often at what men suffer, but I
wonder at what they lose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>

<p>How strange it is to look into a human face, and to look
into human eyes, and to think that a son of the living God is
veiled there—to think of the greatness of that creature, for
the accomplishment of which all creation on earth has been
in travail for these untold ages!</p>

<p>Often not anything extraordinary impresses us as we see
the Christ-nature in a comrade; but wait; we see this kingdom
of the soul only in its germ. The bulb of the tiger-lily is not
over-pretty, but to the eyes that see the possibilities of the
tiger-lily that bulb is a poem. The step from the highest
morality of the natural man to the lowest round in the kingdom
of the spiritual man is a stupendous one. John the
Baptist was the greatest of those born of women; but the
least in the new kingdom of the spiritual man is greater
than he.</p>

<p class="tb">Do not say that you can not be born again. You can and
must. It is natural to step into this kingdom, as natural as
growth is. The natural response of the heart is Christian,
says Tertullian. Our experience supports and justifies this
necessity.</p>

<p>The great original sculptors of Greece, whom all the world
now studies, stayed at home to study as Emerson would say,
and did not bother much with going to Egypt or Mesopotamia.
God is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him, not by
imitation, not outwardly, not with the noise of words that
men may hear, but in the closet, in the silence of the inner
chamber of the soul. Every man must find himself, and be
himself; the new birth and growth in Christ make perfect
each man’s individuality. But there must be another conception
of God than that against which the Buddhists warn
us, that He is a “cow to be milked.”</p>

<p>God hid Himself behind the world of our physical senses
that we, free of all compulsion, might develop the spiritual
man. When that is developed, God can safely reveal His
infinite power and wisdom and goodness. Who could make
free choice in the conscious presence of an infinite One?</p>

<p>Evolution is a sword that cuts both ways. It chooses, it
condemns. The fittest survive. There are many called, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
few chosen. The most pathetic and pitiful thing in all the
world is to see the multitudes striving to get out of the kingdom
of the natural man what is not in it.</p>

<p>Punishment comes—it, too, is natural; and it is largely
within. Degeneracy, through persistent wrong-choosing, is
the law of nature—fixed, inevitable. If a man will not
choose to ascend, he loses his power to choose.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>The scientist is short-sighted and narrow-sighted who
walls science in at the boundary of his senses—a mole accounting
for phenomena, and leaving out the eye; a Laura
Bridgeman accounting for whatever came into her life by her
two or three physical senses.</p>

<p>Foolish wise men, not to know that the surest of all proofs
is to be looked for in inner experience; that the most real
things in the world are made clear not by physical proof, but by
life! Darwin reached the point where poetry and music were
little to him; yet the world of music and of beauty are more
certain than is Mont Blanc or Mount Washington; but there
is only one way to know them, and that is to grow the faculties
of music and beauty. To the Roman soldiers who may
have heard it, how unsubstantial was the Sermon on the
Mount; yet its truths of the brotherhood of man, of the fatherhood
of God, of meekness, of loving, of justice, of faith in
the inner things, outlasted the Roman armies, saw the empire
ground to dust, and their speaker, one thousand nine hundred
years afterward, by far the most potent personality that ever
lived. The mother’s love will outpull gravity, and yet what
scientist has chemically analyzed it, or what dissecting-knife
has revealed its whereabouts? There are brute women to
whom this love is “unthinkable,” “unknowable,” but let them
grow the mother-heart, and then they can think it, know it.</p>

<p>Foolish wise men, ye can discern the shadow of things; look
up and behold the substance! Rochefort said to Gambetta:
“Deafness is not politics.” When will scientists learn that
true science must have eyes and ears open to all experience
within as well as without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Once scientists among moles held a congress, and learnedly
resolved that they would believe in nothing that could not be
submitted for proof to their four senses. One learned mole
with bated breath said: “There must be something above our
four senses. I one day broke through the crust of the earth
and felt strange sensations, and had a glimmering in the rudiments
called eyes by our older philosophers.” “Nonsense!”
said a grayhead among them. “Let us have no transcendentalism;
everything that is must be explained by sound, or by
touch, or by smell, or by the taste. All this talk of a great
central sun with light, making landscapes and from which all
things come, we have no way of proving; and hence to believe
it, or to admit it as an element in accounting for things, is
unscientific. The scientific method, let us never forget, is to
account for all things by the elements which come within the
range of our four senses and the reasoning based upon these
perceptions.”</p>

<p>So it happens that to this day in the cosmic science accepted
among moles the sun has nothing to do with the growth of
plants, the formation of coal-beds, and the rotation of the
seasons.</p>

<p class="tb">How imperfect that history that would content itself with
writing a biography of the acorn, and never take into account
the oak that comes from the acorn and for which the acorn
exists! The oak reveals the acorn; without the oak the acorn
is not explicable. How can any one understand the evolution
of man and not consider the vastly greater segment of his
nature, which is the non-material and spiritual? The scientist
believes in the indestructibility of matter. The step is a
short one to the belief in the indestructibility of spirit. He
believes in substance infinitely extended; the step is not a
long one to belief in the personality that is infinitely extended.
He believes that in all matter is a “thinking substance.” Is
it harder to believe that over and in all things is a thinking
spirit?<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> The scientist endows matter with the powers it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
needs to do all these things, and then says it does all these
things.</p>

<p>Yet science, when it comes to know, when it comes to take
in all the facts, to go deep enough, and wide enough, and
far enough, will be the arbiter. Creed, dogma, authority,
must give way to it. Magellan said: “The Church declares
the world is flat, but I have seen its shadow on the moon, and
I had rather believe a shadow than the Church.” That is
true only when the Church makes provision for but a part of
the truth, and when science is true to itself. The assumptions
of science and the assumptions of the Church will have to be
corrected by <em>experience</em>, the experience of the <em>whole</em> man.</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>Christ is not an idealism, but a living, throbbing, visible,
audible Being—the real Christ; the body in Galilee was the
shadow, the outward shell that could be crushed. The One
now coming is the Mighty One who is out of the reach of
stones and spears, the type-life and potent King of the kingdom
of the spiritual man. And he who hath Him also hath
power. “Ye shall receive <em>power</em>” (Acts i. 8). “Stephen,
full of faith and <em>power</em>” (Acts vi. 8). “The kingdom of
God is not in word, but in <em>power</em>” (1 Cor. iv. 20). Says
Paul of those at Corinth who found fault with him: I will
not know their speech, but their <em>power</em> (1 Cor. iv. 19). He
who has not <em>power</em> is not of the kingdom of the spiritual man,
for “whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.”
This Christ is a present force in the world, producing changes,
quickening and directing energies, and must be reckoned with.
Christian civilization also proves itself by its <em>power</em>.</p>

<p class="tb">But to see Him this time we must have eyes and ears fitted
to recognize the manifestations of the inner kingdom—the
kingdom of all first causes and real forces. He is not coming
with the noise of trumpets, nor with whirlwinds, nor with
earthquakes; but with the silence of the growth of the mustard-seed,
of the leaven, of the grain of corn reaching up to
the blade and full corn in the ear.</p>

<p>There can be nothing more manifest to-day to the optic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
nerve of the spiritual man than is this coming. The lightning
flashing from the east to the west is not nearly so manifest.</p>

<p>Every event is alive with His appearing. His presence is
the most evident thing in the world, the very splendor of the
light hides Him. “Lo, I am with you alway!” is now
known by millions to be a vital, stupendous fact. He is
nearer to such a heart than the mother to the babe.</p>

<p>This coming is in harmony with recognizable law; belief in it
is logic, is common sense. It would be extraordinary, miraculous,
if He did not now come. When it is our will to do His
will, we become the reincarnation of Christ, for “Christ is
formed in us.” When the dominating ones in a community,
in a church, in a nation, in the world, are of this sort, you
see Christ reincarnated in all these. Moses, David, John,
Plato, Augustine, Savonarola, Bunyan, were great ideal dreamers,
but they were also geniuses of common sense. These
men were primarily men of faith and great good sense, not
of credulity. They had the power and common sense to
know that there were voices within, and to withdraw their attention
from the voices without and give the real world a
chance to be heard. They knew that the universe would fall
into chaos and that stars would be ground to dust if these
worlds were disobedient to law. They knew that there was
an inner universe, and that there were inner laws infinitely
more important. They knew it to be the A B C of common
sense to conform to these inner laws. Christ was and is the
embodiment of common sense; and so His followers become
as they grow into the new creatures of the kingdom of the
spiritual man.</p>

<p class="tb">There are voices within distinct and clear to those who have
ears to hear; clearer than silver bells ringing up in air at
midnight. One who has grown this spiritual nature ceases to
talk about the inward world being silent or hid—yet there are
clouds and doubts. These things must needs be—these assailed
Christ to the last. And if angels do not also follow,
ministering to us, it is because we have not reached the plane
of spiritual seeing. Help is always near, and it should not
be necessary for a prophet’s hand to touch our eyes to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
us to see the mountains covered with heavenly allies, or to enable
us to know the signs of the times. There is no room for
fear. Bismarck spoke with the accents of a prophet when he
said: “Germany fears nothing but God.” The cry is gone
out to the ends of the earth: “Great is the soul of man; make
way, make way!”</p>

<p>These signs of a mighty change are deepening and multiplying
as we swing into the new century. The Jewish people
were to be trodden underfoot until the inner kingdom of love
should be established; that barbarism of hate is now rapidly
dying.</p>

<p>Were we wise enough, events all around us would be to us
prophecies of the coming of the triumphant God, of the kingdom
of the spiritual man.</p>

<p>Watch! By watching we develop the ability to discern
things beyond the senses.</p>

<p>Above every cloud the light is now breaking; the earth is
rolling into the dawn of a marvelous day.</p>

<p class="tb">The yoke of ecclesiasticism is giving way to the yoke of
Christ. Creed is the memory of the Church. The real yoke
of Christ is not a burden; it has wings. He is sweetness and
light. Let criticism have its way. The testing-time has
come, give it welcome. A man must now stand a vital
Christian, or a hypocrite, or an open enemy—that will be a
great gain. Creeds to-day are trying to understand one another.
Christianity is being reduced to its least common denominator,
a living Christ. The church is finding it harder
and harder to think of itself as a great-great-grandchild. It
is coming to believe in its present experiences, and to write its
own creeds for to-day, and not for to-morrow. Since God is,
the Church and the world will not necessarily fall to pieces if
they let go their props and scaffoldings. If there be no God,
creeds and forms and ceremonies are necessities. A living
God is efficient and sufficient.</p>

<p class="tb">There is no more unfailing sign of the nearness of Christ
than the growth of loving beyond the provincialism of the family,
the clan, the class, the nation. “Ye are brethren.” All
things in common, was not an impracticable dream, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
fundamental law of the kingdom of the spiritual Man. We
must organize sooner or later on that basis. We are speeding
onward toward that sun. We feel its growing heat. If
we do not love our brethren whom we have seen, how can we
love God whom we have not seen? What do ye mean by the
communion of saints, ye who pray it Sunday by Sunday?
Spell it out. Brotherhood is not a fiction of the imagination.
Communion is not a Pentecostal fantasy. A living Christ is
to-day more than ever on earth an aggressively unifying force.
Immensely human was Christ’s message to man—Brotherhood
and Fatherhood, and by those tokens we recognize His present
footsteps.</p>

<p>Judge these things as you would the motions of the hands
of the clock. Look back a half dozen centuries and make
comparisons. War is recognized more and more as a barbarism,
and its end is over yonder hill. The court of nations to
settle wrongs is looming above the horizon. The nation that
loves its fellow nations is also born of God.</p>

<p class="tb">The humanities are in order. Over one hundred and ten
million dollars were contributed in the United States for educational
and other charities within the last two years.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> Nearly
two million dollars were given to suffering Galveston; and
Carnegie’s immense benefactions are but one of the many indications
of the full dawning of the day of living for others.</p>

<p>A single individual the other day, a member of an unpopular
race, is wronged in France, and all the world is aroused, and
flashes thunderbolts of wrath under oceans and across continents
until there is a beginning to right the wrong. Mankind
is rapidly becoming</p>

<div class="verse indent5">“… One in spirit, and in instinct bears along</div>
<div class="verse">Around the earth’s electric circle the swift flash of right and wrong.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The marvelous sowing about the Sea of Galilee is reaching
its ripening. The leaven is leavening the whole lump. The
mustard-seed reappears in hundreds and hundreds of millions
of seed. Cuba is helped to freedom for its own sake; the
Russian Czar—he at least—in sincerity says: “War should
end.” In business it is ceasing to be a maxim that the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
of the one is ever opposed to the benefit of the many. We
are learning that the Golden Rule and the law of self-preservation
run parallel. Applied to commercialism, the
Golden Rule is so to make money as to give a benefit also to
him from whom you make it; and that, too, is common sense.
The children of the inner kingdom never crowd: the more, the
more room.</p>

<p>In all these things we see just the beginnings of the results
of His coming: all men of one family, God the Father, and
Christ the eldest Brother; the sacredness of truth, of the
soul, of all life; the reality of the inner world.</p>

<p class="tb">Man has climbed up in countless ages by the slow processes
of evolution to where he can use the powers of nature through
his brain—becoming a coworker with God in guiding the
processes of evolution. Now, being reborn into the inner
kingdom, he starts on a new and infinitely higher destiny.
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, the things that are laid up
for those thus born.</p>

<p>With a boundless universe within and without, and an infinite
God, and with an eternity to live and work in, many,
many things can take place, and it is God’s good pleasure
that they shall never take place to our hurt. The creature of
the kingdom of the spiritual man is injury-proof.</p>

<p>And the command is: “Be ye perfect as your Father is
perfect”; ever approaching Him in countless ages and reaching
Him at the end of eternity, had eternity an end; but since
it has no end, in whatever distant period and however great
the distance between us, God is still the Infinite One and we
the finite ones.</p>

<p>Ah, how men err! The Roman Emperor, after his awful
massacre of Christians, set up a column in memory of the
extinction of the last Christian. But the Roman empire is
in dust, and now the world is rapidly becoming wholly Christian;
and were that Emperor alive, he, quite likely, would
applaud the result. God’s steppings are from star to star.
Who knoweth His counsel?</p>

<p>We look back over the conflict of the ages of evolution; we
now see, in the changing of the dunghill into shrubs and roses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
and into food, the prophecy of all, and we marvel at our
blindness in not knowing that the most manifest thing in all
the world, and at all times, was God the Father working for
good, whom again and again we have compelled to cry out in
pain (for God can suffer pain): The reproaches of men have
broken my heart. Looking backward, we begin to see the
good in everything, that there has not been a fall of a sparrow
without accompanying provision for the sparrow, and we grow
enthusiastic and shout with the martyr of old: “Glory be to
God for everything that happens!” Hand-in-hand we walk
with the great Father over the ages of history, riding victorious
over mountain-tops.</p>

<p>We see, modifying the words of John Fiske, that in the
roaring loom of time, out of the endless web of events, strand
by strand, was woven more and more clearly the living garment
of God.</p>

<p class="tb">When Christ had passed beyond the grave, He said
“Mary,” and Mary said “Master”; they spake, they understood,
tho death and the grave intervened. The world of
the physical senses has no barrier that hinders knowing in the
kingdom of the spiritual man.</p>

<p class="tb">“The Wandering Jew” is near the end of his wanderings.</p>

<p>As reasoned the Apostle:<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> If the Gentiles were cut out of
the olive-tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary
to nature into a good olive-tree, how much more shall
the Jews, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their
own olive-tree? For God is able to graft them in again. For
I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this
mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits: that
blindness in part has happened to Israel, <em>until the fulness of
the Gentiles be come in</em>. AND SO ALL ISRAEL SHALL
BE SAVED.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> It has been believed by many from the early ages of the Christian era that among
the signs of Christ’s coming would be the recognition of Him by the Jews, as “one sent
of the Father,” and that they would then be restored to the Father’s favor; that this
recognition would be accompanied by a recolonization of the Jews in Palestine; that
from this vantage-ground, they, as a nation among nations—the “inherent genius of
the Jews for things religious” again reasserting itself—would lead the nations of earth
in final triumph into the kingdom of the spiritual man.</p>

<p>Prof. R. Gottheil, of Columbia University, and president of the Federation of American
Zionists, said, before the Zionist Congress, in the summer of 1900, in London: “It
is time the nations understood our motives. Our purpose is gradually to colonize Palestine.
We political Zionists desire a charter from the Sultan authorizing us to settle
in our Holy Land, and we ask the powers to approve and protect this charter.”</p>

<h2 id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h2>

<p>There has appeared from time to time in Europe, during
the past thousand years, a mysterious individual—a sojourner
in all lands, yet a citizen of none; professing the profoundest
secrets of opulence, yet generally living in a state of poverty;
astonishing every one by the vigor of his recollections, and the
evidence of his intercourse with the eminent characters and
events of every age, yet connected with none—without lineage,
possession, or pursuit on earth—a wanderer and unhappy!</p>

<p>A number of histories have been written about him; some
purely fictitious, others founded on ill-understood records.
Germany, the land of mysticism, has toiled the most in this
idle perversion of truth. Yet those narratives have been in
general but a few pages, feebly founded on the fatal sentence
of his punishment for an indignity offered to the Author of
the Christian faith.</p>

<p>That exile lives! that most afflicted of the people of affliction
yet walks this earth, bearing the sorrows of eighteen centuries
on his brow—withering in soul for the guilt of an hour of
madness. He has long borne the scoff of man in silence; he
has heard his princely rank degraded to that of a menial, and
heard without a murmur; he has heard his unhappy offense
charged to deliberate malice, when it was but the misfortune
of a zeal inflamed by the passions of his people; and he has
bowed to the calumny as a portion of his punishment. But
the time for this forbearance is no more. He feels himself
at last wearing away; and feels, with a sensation like that
of returning to the common fates of mankind, a desire to
stand clear with his fellow men. In their presence he will
never move again; to their justice, or their mercy, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
never again appeal. The wound of his soul rests, never again
to be disclosed, until that day when all beings shall be summoned
and all secrets be known.</p>

<p>In his final retreat he has collected these memorials. He
has concealed nothing; he has dissembled nothing; the picture
of his hopes and fears, his weaknesses and his sorrows, is
stamped here with sacred sincerity.</p>

<p>Other narratives may be more specious or eloquent, but this
narrative has the supreme merit of reality. It may be
doubted; it may even be denied. But this he must endure.
He has been long trained to the severity of the world!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Feels Remorse</div>

<p>“Tarry thou till I come.”<a name="ENanchor_1" id="ENanchor_1"></a><a href="#Endnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The words shot through
me—I felt them like an arrow in my heart—my brain whirled—my
eyes grew dim. The troops, the priests, the populace,
the world, passed away from before my senses like phantoms.</p>

<p>But my mind had a horrible clearness. As if the veil that
separates the visible and invisible worlds had been rent in
sunder, I saw shapes and signs for which mortal language
has no name. The whole expanse of the future spread under
my mental gaze. A preternatural light, a new power of
mind, seemed to have been poured into my being; I saw at
once the full guilt of my crime—the fierce folly—the mad
ingratitude—the desperate profanation. I lived over again in
frightful distinctness every act and instant of the night of my
unspeakable sacrilege. I saw, as if written with a sunbeam,
the countless injuries that in the rage of bigotry I had accumulated
upon the victim; the bitter mockeries that I had devised;
the cruel tauntings that my lips had taught the rabble; the
pitiless malignity that had forbidden them to discover a trace
of virtue where all virtue was. The blows of the scourge
still sounded in my ears. Every drop of the innocent blood
rose up in judgment against me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Former Triumph</div>

<p>Accursed be the night in which I fell before the tempter!
Blotted out from time and eternity be the hour in which I
took part with the torturers! Every fiber of my frame quivers,
every drop of my blood curdles, as I still hear the echo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of the anathema, that on the night of wo sprang first from
my lips, “<span class="smcap">His blood be upon us, and upon our children!</span>”</p>

<p>I had headed the multitude; where others shrank, I urged;
where others pitied, I reviled; I scoffed at the feeble malice
of the priesthood; I scoffed at the tardy cruelty of the Roman;
I swept away by menace and by scorn the human reluctance
of the few who dreaded to dip their hands in blood. Thinking
to do God service, and substituting my passions for my
God, I threw firebrands on the hearts of a rash, jealous, and
bigoted people—I triumphed!</p>

<p>In a deed which ought to have covered earth with lamentation,
which was to make angels weep, which might have
shaken the universe into dust, I triumphed! The decree was
passed; but my frenzy was not so to be satiated. I loathed
the light while the victim lived. Under the charge of “treason
to Cæsar,” I demanded instant execution of the sentence.—“Not
a day of life must be given,” I exclaimed, “not an
hour;—death, on the instant; death!” My clamor was
echoed by the roar of millions.</p>

<p>But in the moment of my exultation I was stricken. He
who had refused an hour of life to the victim was, in terrible
retribution, condemned to know the misery of life interminable.
I heard through all the voices of Jerusalem—I should
have heard through all the thunders of heaven—the calm, low
voice, “Tarry thou till I come!”</p>

<p>I felt my fate at once! I sprang away through the shouting
hosts as if the avenging angel waved his sword above my
head. Wild songs, furious execrations, the uproar of myriads
stirred to the heights of passion, filled the air; still, through
all, I heard the pursuing sentence, “Tarry thou till I come,”
and felt it to be the sentence of incurable agony! I was never
to know the shelter of the grave!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Ceaseless Wanderer</div>

<p>Immortality on Earth!—The compulsion of perpetual existence
in a world made for change; to feel thousands of years
bowing down my wretched head; alienated from all the hopes,
enjoyments, and pursuits of man, to bear the heaviness of that
existence which palls even with all the stimulants of the most
vivid career of man; life passionless, exhausted, melancholy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
old. I was to be a wild beast; and a wild beast condemned
to pace the same eternal cage! A criminal bound to the floor
of his dungeon forever! I would rather have been blown about
on the storms of every region of the universe.</p>

<p>Immortality on Earth!—I was still in the vigor of life; but
must it be always so? Must not pain, feebleness, the loss of
mind, the sad decay of all the resources of the human being,
be the natural result of time? Might I not sink into the perpetual
sick-bed, hopeless decrepitude, pain without cure or
relaxation, the extremities of famine, of disease, of madness?—yet
this was to be borne for ages of ages!</p>

<p>Immortality on Earth!—Separation from all that cheers and
ennobles life. I was to survive my country; to see the soil
dear to my heart violated by the feet of barbarians yet unborn,
her sacred monuments, her trophies, her tombs, a scoff
and a spoil. Without a resting-spot for the soles of my feet,
I was to witness the slave, the man of blood, the savage of
the desert, the furious infidel, rioting in my inheritance, digging
up the bones of my fathers, trampling on the holy ruins
of Jerusalem!</p>

<p>Immortality on Earth!—I was to feel the still keener misery
of surviving all whom I loved; wife, child, friend, even
to the last being with whom my heart could imagine a human
bond; all that bore a drop of my blood in their veins were
to perish in my sight, and I was to stand on the verge of the
perpetual grave, without the power to sink into its refuge.
If new affections could ever wind their way into my frozen
bosom, it must be only to fill it with new sorrows; for those
I loved must still be torn from me.—In the world I must remain,
and remain alone!</p>

<p>Immortality on Earth!—The grave that closes on the sinner,
closes on his sin. His weight of offense is fixed. No
new guilt can gather on him there. But I was to know no
limit to the weight that was already crushing me. The guilt
of life upon life, the surges of an unfathomable ocean of crime,
were to roll in eternal progress over my head. If the judgment
of the great day was terrible to him who had passed but
through the common measure of existence, what must be its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
terrors to the wretch who was to appear loaded with the accumulated
guilt of a thousand lives!</p>

<div class="sidenote">He Passes through Jerusalem</div>

<p>Overwhelmed with despair, I rushed through Jerusalem,
with scarcely a consciousness of whither I was going. It was
the time of the Passover, when the city was crowded with the
multitude come to the great festival of the year. I felt an
instinctive horror of the human countenance, and shunned
every avenue by which the tribes came in. I at last found
myself at the Gate of Zion, that leads southward into the open
country. I had then no eyes for that wondrous portal which
had exhausted the skill of the most famous Ionian sculptors,
the master-work of Herod the Great. But I vainly tried to
force my way through the crowds that lingered on their march
to gaze upon its matchless beauty; portal alone worthy of the
wonders to which it led, like the glory of an evening cloud
opening to lead the eye upward to the stars.</p>

<p>On those days the Roman guard was withdrawn from the
battlements, which I ascended to seek another escape; but the
concourse, gathered there to look upon the entrance of the
tribes, fixed me to the spot. Of all the strange and magnificent
sights of earth, this entrance was the most fitted to swell
the national pride of country and religion. The dispersion,
ordained by Heaven for judgment on the crimes of our idolatrous
kings, had, through that wonder-working power by
which good is brought out of evil, planted our law in the remotest
extremities of the world. Among its proselytes were
the mighty of all regions, the military leaders, the sages, the
kings; all, at least once in their lives, coming to pay homage
to the great central city of the faith; and all coming with the
pomp and attendance of their rank. The procession amounted
to a number which threw after-times into the shade. Three
millions of people have been counted at the Passover.</p>

<p>The diversities of the multitude were not less striking.
Every race of mankind, in its most marked peculiarities, there
passed beneath the eye. There came the long train of swarthy
slaves and menials round the chariot of the Indian prince,
clothed in the silks and jewels of regions beyond the Ganges.
Upon them pressed the troop of African lion-hunters, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
naked, but with their black limbs wreathed with pearl and
fragments of unwrought gold. Behind them, on camels,
moved patriarchal groups, the Arab sheik, a venerable figure
with his white locks flowing from beneath his turban, leading
his sons, like our father Abraham, from the wilderness to the
Mount of Vision. Then rolled on the glittering chariot of
the Assyrian chieftain, a regal show of purple and gems, convoyed
by horsemen covered with steel. The Scythian Jews,
wrapped in the furs of wolf and bear, iron men of the
North; the noble Greek, the perfection of the human form,
with his countenance beaming the genius and beauty of his
country; the broad and yellow features of the Chinese rabbins;
the fair skins and gigantic forms of the German tribes;
strange clusters of men unknown to the limits of Europe or
Asia, with their black locks, complexions of the color of gold,
and slight yet sinewy limbs, marked with figures of suns and
stars struck into the flesh; all marched crowd on crowd; and
in strong contrast with them, the Italian on the charger or in
the chariot, urging the living stream to the right and left,
with the haughtiness of the acknowledged master of mankind.
The representative world was before me. But all those distinctive
marks of country and condition, though palpably ineradicable
by human means, were overpowered and mingled
by the one grand impression of the place and the time. In
their presence was the City of Holiness; the Hill of Zion
lifted up its palaces; above them ascended, like another city
in a higher region of the air, that <span class="smcap">Temple</span> to whose majesty
the world could show no equal, to which the eyes of the believer
were turned from the uttermost parts of the earth, in
whose courts Solomon, the king of earthly kings for wisdom,
had called down the blessing of the Most High, and it had
descended on the altar in fire; in whose sanctuary the King
whom heaven and the heaven of heavens can not contain was
to make His future throne, and give glory to His people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And Comes upon a Scene Magnificent</div>

<p>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! when I think of what I saw thee
then, and of what I have since seen thee—the spoiled, the
desolate, the utterly put to shame; when I have seen the
Roman plow driven through the soil on which stood the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of Holies; the Saracen destroying even its ruins; the last,
worst devastator, the barbarian of the Tatar desert, sitting
in grim scorn upon the ramparts of the city of David; violating
the tombs of the prophet and the king; turning up for
plunder the soil, every blade of whose grass, every atom of
whose dust, was sacred to the broken heart of Israel; trampling
with savage cruelty my countrymen that lingered among
its walls only that they might seek a grave in the ashes of the
mighty,—I have felt my spirit maddened within me. I have
made impious wishes; I have longed for the lightning to blast
the tyrant. I still start from my bed when I hear the whirlwind,
and send forth fierce prayers that its rage may be poured
on the tents of the oppressor. I unconsciously tear away my
white locks, and scatter them in bitterness of soul toward the
East. In the wildness of the moment I have imagined every
cloud that sailed along the night a minister of the descending
vengeance. I have seen it a throne of terrible shapes flying
on the wings of the wind, majestic spirits and kings of wrath
hurrying through the heavens to pour down sulfurous hail
and fire, as upon the cities of the Dead Sea. I have cried out
with our prophet, as the vision swept along, “Who is he that
cometh from Edom? with dyed garments from Bozra? he that
is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his
strength! Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy
garments like him that treadeth the winepress?” and I have
thought that I heard the answer: “I, that speak in righteousness,
mighty to save! I will tread them in mine anger, and
trample them in my fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled
upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment; for the
day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed
is come!”</p>

<p>Then, when the impulse passed away, my eyes have turned
into fountains of tears, and I have wept until morning came,
and the sounds of the world called back its recollections; and
for the sacred hills and valleys that I had imagined in the
darkness I saw only the roofs of some melancholy city, in
which I was a forlorn fugitive; or a wilderness, with but the
burning sands and the robber before me; or found myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
tossing on the ocean, not more fruitless than my heart, nor
more restless than my life, nor more unfathomable than my
we. Yet to the last will I hope and love. O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem! even in my mirth, if I forget thee!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beyond the
City’s Gate</div>

<p>But those were the thoughts of after-times. On that memorable
and dreadful day I had no perception but of some
undefinable fate which was to banish me from mankind. I
at length forced my way through the pressure at the gate,
turned to none of the kinsmen who called to me as I passed
their chariots and horses, overthrew with desperate and sudden
strength all who impeded my progress, and scarcely felt
the ground till I had left the city behind, and had climbed,
through rocks and ruins, the mountain that rose drearily before
me, like a barrier shutting out the living world.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>An Awakening and a Summons</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Dream</div>

<p>Terror had exhausted me; and throwing myself on the
ground, under the shade of the palm-trees that crowned the
summit of the hill, I fell into an almost instant slumber.
But it was unrefreshing and disturbed. The events of the
day again came before me, strangely mingled with those of
my past life, and with others of which I could form no waking
remembrance. I saw myself sometimes debased below
man, like the great Assyrian king, driven out to feed upon
the herb of the forest, and wandering for years exposed to the
scorching sun by day and the dews that sank chilling upon
my naked frame by night; I then seemed filled with supernatural
power, and rose on wings till earth was diminished
beneath me, and I felt myself fearfully alone. Still, there
was one predominant sensation: that all this was for punishment,
and that it was to be perpetual. At length, in one of
my imaginary flights, I found myself whirled on the wind,
like a swimmer down a cataract, in helpless terror into the
bosom of a thunder-cloud. I felt the weight of the rolling
vapors round me; I saw the blaze; I was stunned by a roar
that shook the firmament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the Mount of Corruption</div>

<p>My eyes suddenly opened, yet my dream appeared only to
be realized by my waking. Thick clouds of heavy and heated
vapor were rapidly rolling up from the precipices below; and
at intervals a sound that I could not distinguish from distant
thunder burst on the wind. But the sun was bright, and the
horizon was the dazzling blue of the eastern heaven. As my
senses slowly returned, for I felt like a man overpowered with
wine, I was enabled to discover where I was. The discovery
itself was terror. I had in my distraction fled to the mountain
on which no Jew ever looked without shame and sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
for the crimes of the greatest king into whose nostrils the
Almighty ever poured the spirit of life, but which a Jewish
priest, as I was, could not touch without being guilty of defilement.
I sat on the Mount of Corruption,<a name="ENanchor_2" id="ENanchor_2"></a><a href="#Endnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> so-called from
its having once witnessed the idolatries of our mighty Solomon,
when, in his old age, he gave way to the persuasions of
his heathen wives—that irreparable crime for which the kingdom
was rent, and the strength of Israel scattered. I saw in
the hollows of the hill the spaces, still bearing the marks of
burning, and barren forever, on which the temples of Moloch,
Chemosh, and Ashtaroth had stood in sight of the House of
the living God. The very palm-trees under which I had
snatched that wild and bitter sleep were the remnant of the
groves in which the foul rites of the goddesses of Phenicia
and Assyria once filled the air with midnight abomination,
and horrid yells of human sacrifice, almost made more fearful
by the roar of barbarian revel, the wild dissonance of timbrel
and horn, the bacchanalian chorus of the priesthood and people
of impurity.</p>

<p>The vapors that rose hot and sickly before me were the
smokes from the fires kindled in the valley of Hinnom; where
the refuse of the animals slaughtered for the use of the city,
and the other pollutions and remnants of things abominable to
the Jew, were daily burned. The sullen and perpetual fires,
the deadly fumes, and the aspects of the beings, chiefly public
criminals, who were employed in this hideous task, gave
the idea of the place of final evil. Our prophets, in their
threats against the national betrayers, against the proud and
the self-willed, the polluted with idols, and the polluted with
that still darker and more incurable idolatry, the worship of
the world, pointed to the valley of Hinnom! The Pharisee,
when he denounced the unbelief and luxury of the lordly Sadducee,
pointed to the valley of Hinnom! All—the Pharisee,
the Essene, the Sadducee, in the haughty spirit that forgot
the fallen state of Jerusalem, and the crimes that had lowered
her; the hypocrite, the bigot, and the skeptic, alike mad with
hopeless revenge, when they saw the Roman cohorts triumphing
with their idolatrous ensigns through the paths once trod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by the holy, or were driven aside by the torrent of cavalry,
and the gilded chariot on which sat some insolent proconsul
fresh from Italy,—pointed to the valley of Hinnom! How
often, as the days of Jerusalem hurried toward their end and
by some fatality the violences of the Roman governors became
more frequent and intolerable, have I seen the groups of
my countrymen, hunted into some byway of the city by the
hoofs of the Roman horse, consuming with that inward wrath
which was soon to flame out in such horrors, flinging up their
wild hands, as if to upbraid the tardy heavens, gnashing their
teeth, and with the strong contortions of the Oriental countenance,
and lip scarcely audible from the force of its own convulsion,
muttering conspiracy. Or, in despair of shaking off
that chain which had bound the whole earth, how often have
I seen them appealing to the endless future, and shrouding
their heads in their cloaks, like sorcerers summoning up demons,
each with his quivering hand stretched out toward the
accursed valley, and every tongue groaning “Hinnom!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Call
to Duty</div>

<p>While I lay upon the summit of the mountain, in a state
which gave me the deepest impression of the parting of soul
and body, I was startled by the sound of a trumpet. It was
from the Temple, which, as the fires below sank with the
growing heat of the day, was now visible to me. The trumpet
was the signal of the third hour, when the first daily sacrifice
was to be offered. It was the week of the class of
Abiah, of which I was, and this day’s service fell to me.
Though I would have given all that I possessed on earth to
be allowed to rest upon that spot, polluted as it was, and
there molder away into the dust and ashes that I had made
my bed, I dared not shrink from that most solemn duty of
the priesthood.</p>

<p>I rose, but it was not until after many efforts that I was
able to stand. I struggled along the summit of the ridge,
holding by the stems of the palm-trees. The second trumpet
sounded loudly, and was reechoed by the cliffs. I had now
no time for delay, and was about to spring downward toward
a path which wound round the head of the valley and beyond
the fires, when my ears were again arrested by the peal that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
had disturbed me in my sleep, and my glance, which commanded
the whole circuit of the hills round Jerusalem, involuntarily
looked for the thunder-cloud. The sky was without
a stain; but the eminences toward the west, on whose lovely
slopes of vineyard, rose, and orange grove my eye had so often
reposed as on a vast Tyrian carpet tissued with purple and
gold, were hung with gloom; a huge and sullen cloud seemed
to be gathering over the heights, and flashes and gleams of
malignant luster burst from its bosom. The cloud deepened,
and the distant murmur grew louder and more continued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Returns to
His Home</div>

<p>I hurried to the city gate. To my astonishment, I found
the road, that I had left, so choked up with the multitude,
almost empty. The camels stood tethered in long trains under
the trees, with scarcely an owner. The tents were deserted
except by children and the few old persons necessary for
their care. The mules and horses grazed through the fields
without a keeper. I saw tents full of the animals and other
offerings that the tribes brought up to the great feast, almost
at the mercy of any hand that would take them away.
Where could the myriads have disappeared which had covered
the land a few hours before to the horizon?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Hears Familiar Sounds</div>

<p>The city was still more a subject of astonishment. A panic
might have driven away the concourse of strangers, at a time
when the violences of the Roman sword had given every Jew
but too frequent cause for the most sensitive alarm. But all
within the gate was equally deserted. The streets were utterly
stripped of the regular inhabitants. The Roman sentinels
were almost the only beings whom I could discover in my passage
of the long avenue, from the foot of the upper city to the
Mount of the Temple. All this was favorable to my extreme
anxiety to escape every eye of my countrymen; yet I can not
tell with what a throbbing of heart, and variety of feverish
emotion, I at length reached the threshold of my dwelling.
Though young, I was a husband and father. What might not
have happened since the sunset of the evening before? for my
evil doings—for which may He, with whom mercy lies at the
right hand and judgment at the left, have mercy on me—had
fatally occupied the night. I listened at the door, with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
heart upon my lips. I dared not open it. My suspense was
at length relieved by my wife’s voice; she was weeping. I
fell on my knees, and thanked Heaven that she was alive.</p>

<p>But my infant! I thought of the sword that smote the
first-born in the land of bondage, and felt that Judah, guilty
as Egypt, might well dread its punishment. Was it for my
first-born that the sobs of its angel mother had arisen in her
loneliness? Another pause of bitter suspense—and I heard
the laugh of my babe as it awoke in her arms. The first
human sensation that I had felt for so many hours was
almost overpowering; and without regarding the squalidness
of my dress, and the look of famine and fatigue that must
have betrayed where I had been, I should have rushed into
the chamber. But at that moment the third trumpet sounded.
I had now no time for the things of this world. I plunged
into the bath, cleansed myself from the pollution of the mountain,
hastily girt on me the sacerdotal tunic and girdle; and
with the sacred fillet on my burning brow, and the censer in
my shaking hand, passed through the cloisters and took my
place before the altar.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Salathiel’s Resolution in the Temple</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Before the
Temple</div>

<p>Of all the labors of human wealth and power devoted to
worship, the Temple within whose courts I then stood was the
most mighty. In the years of my unhappy wanderings, far
from the graves of my kindred, I have seen all the most famous
shrines of the great kingdoms of idolatry. Constrained
by cruel circumstance, and the still sterner cruelty of man, I
have stood before the altar of the Ephesian Diana, the masterpiece
of Ionian splendor; I have strayed through the woods
of Delphi, and been made a reluctant witness of the superb
mysteries of that chief of the oracles of imposture. Dragged
in chains, I have been forced to join the procession round the
Minerva of the Acropolis, and almost forgot my chains in
wonder at that monument of a genius which ought to have
been consecrated only to the true God, by whom it was given.
The temple of the Capitoline Jove, the Sancta Sophia of the
Rome of Constantine, the still more stupendous fabric in
which the third Rome still bows before the fisherman of Galilee—all
have been known to my step, that knows all things
but rest; but all were dreams and shadows to the grandeur,
the dazzling beauty, the almost unearthly glory, of that Temple
which once covered the “Mount of Vision” of the City of
<span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>.</p>

<p>At the distance of almost two thousand years, I have its
image on my mind’s eye with living and painful fulness. I
see the court of the Gentiles circling the whole; a fortress of
the purest marble, with its wall rising six hundred feet from
the valley; its kingly entrance, worthy of the fame of Solomon;
its innumerable and stately buildings for the priests
and officers of the Temple, and above them, glittering like a
succession of diadems, those alabaster porticoes and colonnades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in which the chiefs and sages of Jerusalem sat teaching
the people, or walked, breathing the pure air, and gazing on
the grandeur of a landscape which swept the whole amphitheater
of the mountains. I see, rising above this stupendous
boundary, the court of the Jewish women separated by its
porphyry pillars and richly sculptured wall; above this, the
separated court of the men; still higher, the court of the
priests; and highest, the crowning splendor of all, the central
<span class="smcapuc">TEMPLE</span>,<a name="ENanchor_3" id="ENanchor_3"></a><a href="#Endnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the place of the Sanctuary and of the Holy of
Holies, covered with plates of gold, its roof planted with
lofty spear-heads of gold, the most precious marbles and
metals everywhere flashing back the day, till Mount Moriah
stood forth to the eye of the stranger approaching Jerusalem
what it had been so often described by its bards and people,
“a mountain of snow studded with jewels.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">An
Interruption</div>

<p>The grandeur of the worship was worthy of this glory of
architecture. Four-and-twenty thousand Levites ministered
by turns—a thousand at a time. Four thousand more performed
the lower offices. Four thousand singers and minstrels,
with the harp, the trumpet, and all the richest instruments
of a land whose native genius was music, and whose
climate and landscape led men instinctively to delight in the
charm of sound, chanted the inspired songs of our warrior
king, and filled up the pauses of prayer with harmonies that
transported the spirit beyond the cares and passions of a
troubled world.</p>

<p>I was standing before the altar of burnt-offerings, with the
Levite at my side holding the lamb; the cup was in my hand,
and I was about to pour the wine on the victim, when I was
startled by the sound of hurried feet. In another moment the
gate of the court was abruptly thrown back, and a figure rushed
in; it was the High Priest,<a name="ENanchor_4" id="ENanchor_4"></a><a href="#Endnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but not in the robes of ceremony
which it was customary for him to wear in the seasons of the
greater festivals. He was covered with the common vesture
of the priesthood, and was evidently anxious to use it for total
concealment. His face was buried in the folds of his cloak,
and he walked with blind precipitation toward the sanctuary.
But he had scarcely reached it when a new feeling stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
him, and he turned to the altar, where I was standing in
mute surprise. The cloak fell from his visage; it was pale
as death; the habitual sternness of feature which rendered
him a terror to the people had collapsed into feebleness; and
while he gazed on the flame, I thought I saw the glistening
of a tear on a cheek that had never exhibited human emotion
before. But no time was left for question, even if reverence
had not restrained me. He suddenly grasped the head of the
lamb, as was customary for those who offered up an expiation
for their own sins; his lip, ashy white, quivered with broken
prayer; then, snatching the knife from the Levite, he plunged
it into the animal’s throat, and with his hands covered with
blood, and with a groan that sounded despair, again rushed
distractedly to the porch of the Holy House, flung aside in
fierce irreverence the veil of the sanctuary, and darted in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The High
Priest in
Terror</div>

<p>There was a subterranean passage from the interior of the
sanctuary to the High Priest’s cloister, through which I conceived
that he had gone. But, on passing near the porch, at
the close of the sacrifice, I heard a cry of agony from within
that penetrated my soul.</p>

<p>I had never loved the head of our priesthood. He was a
haughty and hard-hearted man; insolent in his office, which
he had obtained by no unsuspicious means, and a ready tool
alike of the popular caprice and of the tyranny of our foreign
masters. But he was a man; was a man of my own order;
and was it for one like me to triumph over even the most
abject criminal of earth? I ascended the steps of the porch,
and, with a sinking heart and trembling hand, entered the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>But—what I saw there I have no power to tell! To this
moment the recollection overwhelms my senses. Words
were not made to utter it. The ear of man was not made to
hear it. Before me moved things mightier than of mortal
vision, thronging shapes of terror, mysterious grandeurs,
essential power, embodied prophecy! The Veil was rent in
twain! How could man behold and live! When I lifted my
face from the ground again, I saw but the High Priest. He
was kneeling, with his hands clasped upon his eyes; his lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
strained wide, as if laboring to utter a voice; and his whole
frame rigid and cold as a corpse. I vainly spoke, and attempted
to rouse him; terror, or more than terror, had benumbed
his powers; and, unwilling to suffer him to be seen
in this extremity, I bore him in my arms to the subterranean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Attack by
the Romans</div>

<p>But a tumult, of which I could scarcely conjecture the
cause, checked me. The trampling of multitudes, and cries
of fury and fear, echoed round the Temple; and in the sudden
apprehension, the first and most fearful to the priest of Judah,
that the Romans were about to commence their often-threatened
plunder, I laid down my unhappy burden beside the
door of the passage and returned to defend, or die with, our
perishing glory. The sanctuary in which I stood was wholly
lighted by the lamps round its walls. But when, at length,
unable to suppress my alarm at the growing uproar, I went
to the porch, I left comparative day behind me; a gloom
deeper than that of tempest and sicklier than that of smoke
overspread the sky. The sun, which I had seen like a fiery
buckler hanging over the city, was utterly gone. Even while
I looked the darkness deepened, and the blackness of night,
of night without a star, fell far and fearful upon the horizon.</p>

<p>It has been my fate, and an intense part of my punishment,
always to conceive that the calamities of nature and nations
were connected with my crime.<a name="ENanchor_5" id="ENanchor_5"></a><a href="#Endnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I have tried to reason away
this impression, but it has clung to me like an iron chain;
nothing could tear it away that left the life; I have felt it
hanging over my brain with the weight of a thunder-cloud.
As I glanced into the gloom, the thought smote me that it
was I who had brought this Egyptian plague, this horrid
privation of the first element of life, upon my country, perhaps
upon the world, perhaps never to be relieved; for it
came condensing, depth on depth, till it seemed to have excluded
all possibility of the existence of light; it was, like
that of our old oppressors, darkness that might be felt, the
darkness of a universal grave.</p>

<p>I formed my fierce determination at once, and resolved to
fly from my priesthood, from my kindred, from my country;
to linger out my days—my bitter, banished days—in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
wilderness, where my presence would not be a curse, where
but the lion and the tiger should be my fellow dwellers, where
the sands could not be made the more barren for my fatal
tread, nor the fountains more bitter for my desperate and
eternal tears. The singular presence of mind found in some
men in the midst of universal perturbation—one of the most
effective qualities of our nature, and attributed to the highest
vigor of heart and understanding—is not always deserving of
such proud parentage. It is sometimes the child of mere
brute ignorance of danger, sometimes of habitual ferocity; in
my instance it was that of madness—the fierce energy that
leads the maniac safe over roofs and battlements. All in the
Temple was confusion. The priests lay flung at the feet of
the altar; or, clinging together in groups of helplessness and
dismay, waited speechless for the ruin that was to visit them
in this unnatural night. I walked through all, without a fear
or a hope under heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the Midst
of Confusion</div>

<p>Through the solid gloom, and among heaps of men and
sacred things cast under my feet, like the spoil of some
stormed camp, I made my way to my dwelling, direct and
unimpeded, as if I walked in the light of day. I found my
wife in deeper terror at my long absence than even at the
darkness. She sprang forward at my voice, and, falling on
my neck, shed the tears of joy and love. But few words
passed between us, for but few were necessary, to bid her
with her babe to follow me. She would have followed me to
the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>O Miriam, Miriam! how often have I thought of thee, in
my long pilgrimage! How often, like that of a spirit descended
to minister consolation to the wanderer, have I seen, in my
midnight watching, thy countenance of more than woman’s
beauty! To me thou hast never died. Thy more than man’s
loftiness of soul; thy generous fidelity of love to a wayward
and unhappy heart; thy patient treading with me along the
path that I had sowed with the thorn and thistle for thy feet,
but which should have been covered with the wealth of
princes, to be worthy of thy loveliness and thy virtue—all rise
in memory, and condemnation, before the chief of sinners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Age after age have I traveled to thy lonely grave; age after
age have I wept and prayed upon the dust that was once perfection.
In all the hardness forced upon me by a stern world;
in all the hatred of mankind that the insolence of the barbarian
and the persecutor has bound round my bosom like a mail
of iron, I have preserved one source of feeling sacred—a solitary
fount to feed the little vegetation of a withered heart: the
love of thee; perhaps to be a sign of that regenerate time
when the curse shall be withdrawn; perhaps to be in mercy
the source from which that more than desert, thy husband’s
soul, shall be refreshed, and the barrenness nourish with the
flowers of the paradise of God!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel and
Miriam</div>

<p>Throwing off my robe of priesthood, as I then thought,
forever, I went forth, followed by my heroic wife and bearing
my child in my arms. I had left behind me sumptuous
things, wealth transmitted from a long line of illustrious
ancestry. I cared not for them. Wealth a thousand
times more precious was within my embrace. Yet, when
I touched the threshold, the last sensation of divorce from
all that I had been came over my mind. My wife felt the
trembling of my frame, and, with a gentle firmness which
in the hour of trouble often exalts the fortitude of woman
above the headlong and inflamed courage of the warrior, she
bade me be of good cheer. I felt her lips on my hand at the
moment—the touch gave new energy to my whole being—and
I bounded forward into the ocean of darkness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Scene of Disaster</div>

<p>Without impediment or error, I made my way over and
among the crowds that strewed the court of the Gentiles. I
heard many a prayer and many a groan; but I had now no
more to do with man, and forced my way steadily to the great
portal. Thus far, if I had been stricken with utter blindness,
I could not have been less guided by the eye. But, on passing
into the streets of the lower city, a scattered torch, from
time to time, struggling through the darkness, like the lamp
in a sepulcher, gave me glimpses of the scene. The broad
avenue was encumbered with the living, in the semblance of
the dead. All were prostrated or were in those attitudes into
which men are thrown by terror beyond the strength or spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of man to resist. The cloud that, from my melancholy bed
above the valley of Hinnom, I had seen rolling up the hills,
was this multitude. A spectacle had drawn them all by a
cruel, a frantic, curiosity out of Jerusalem, and left it the
solitude that had surprised me. Preternatural eclipse and
horror fell on them, and their thousands madly rushed back
to perish, if perish they must, within the walls of the City of
Holiness. Still the multitude came pouring in; their distant
trampling had the sound of a cataract, and their outcries of
pain, and rage, and terror were like what I have since heard,
but more feebly, sent up from the field of battle.</p>

<p>I struggled on, avoiding the living torrent, and slowly
treading my way wherever I heard the voices least numerous;
but my task was one of extreme toil, and but for those
more than the treasures of the earth to me, whose lives
depended on my efforts, I should willingly have lain down
and suffered the multitude to trample me into the grave.
How long I thus struggled I know not. But a yell of peculiar
and universal terror that burst round me made me turn
my reluctant eyes toward Jerusalem. The cause of this new
alarm was seen at once.</p>

<p>A large sphere of fire fiercely shot through the heavens,
lighting its track down the murky air, and casting a disastrous
and pallid illumination on the myriads of gazers below.
It stopped above the city and exploded in thunder, flashing
over the whole horizon, but covering the Temple with a blaze
which gave it the aspect of a huge mass of metal glowing in
the furnace. Every outline of the architecture, every pillar,
every pinnacle, was seen with a livid and terrible distinctness.
Again, all vanished. I heard the hollow roar of an earthquake;
the ground rose and heaved under our feet. I heard
the crash of buildings, the fall of fragments of the hills, and,
louder than both, the groan of the multitude. I caught my
wife and child closer to my bosom. In the next moment I
felt the ground give way beneath me, a sulfurous vapor took
away my breath, and I was swept into the air in a whirlwind
of dust and ashes!</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Salathiel Journeys Far from Jerusalem</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Returns to
Consciousness</div>

<p>When I recovered my senses, all was so much changed
round me that I could scarcely be persuaded that either the
past or the present was not a dream. I had no consciousness
of any interval between them, more than that of having closed
my eyes at one instant, to open them at the next. Yet the
curtains of a tent waved round me, in a breeze fragrant with
the breath of roses and balsam-trees. Beyond the gardens
and meadows, from which those odors sprang, a river shone,
like a path of lapis lazuli, in the calm effulgence of the western
sun. Tents were pitched, from which I heard the sounds
of pastoral instruments; camels were drinking and grazing
along the riverside; and turbaned men and maidens were
ranging over the fields, or sitting on the banks to enjoy the
cool of the delicious evening.</p>

<p>While I tried to collect my senses and discover whether
this was more than one of those sports of a wayward fancy
which tantalize the bed of the sick mind, I heard a low hymn,
and listened to the sounds with breathless anxiety. The voice
I knew at once—it was Miriam’s. But in the disorder of my
brain, and the strange circumstances which had filled the latter
days, in that total feebleness too in which I could not move
a limb or utter a word, a persuasion seized me that I was
already beyond the final boundary of mortals. All before me
was like that paradise from which the crime of our great forefather
had driven man into banishment. I remembered the
convulsion of the earth in which I had sunk, and asked myself,
Could man be wrapped in flame and the whirlwind that
tore up mountains like the roots of flowers, and yet live?</p>

<div class="sidenote">And Learns of His Narrow Escape</div>

<p>In this perplexity I closed my eyes to collect my thoughts,
and probably exhibited some strong emotion of countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for I was roused by a cry: “He lives! He lives!” I looked
up—Miriam stood before me, clasping her lovely hands with
the wildness of joy unspeakable, and shedding tears that,
large and lustrous, fell down her glowing cheeks like dew
upon the pomegranate. She threw herself upon my pillow,
kissed my forehead with lips that breathed new life into me;
then, pressing my chill hand between hers, knelt down and
with a look worthy of that heaven on which it was fixed,
radiant with beauty, and holiness, and joy as the face of an
angel, offered up her thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The explanation of the scene that perplexed me was given
in a few words, interrupted only by tears and sighs of delight.
With the burst of the earthquake the supernatural darkness
had cleared away. I was flung under the shelter of one of
those caves which abound in the gorges of the mountains
round Jerusalem. Miriam and her infant were flung by my
side, yet unhurt. While I lay insensible in her arms, she,
by singular good fortune, found herself surrounded by a troop
of our kinsmen returning from the city, where terror had
suffered but few to remain. They placed her and her infant
on their camels. Me they would have consigned to the
sepulcher of the priests; but Miriam was not to be shaken
in her purpose to watch over me until all hope was gone. I
was thus carried along—and they were now three days on
their journey homeward. The landscape before me was
Samaria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Power of Art</div>

<p>My natural destination would have been the cities of the
priests<a name="ENanchor_6" id="ENanchor_6"></a><a href="#Endnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which lay to the south, bordering upon Hebron. In
those thirteen opulent and noble residences allotted to the
higher ministry of the Temple, they enjoyed all that could
be offered by the munificent wisdom of the state—wealth
that raised them above the pressures of life, yet not so great
as to extinguish the desire of intellectual distinction or the
love of the loftier virtues. The means of mental cultivation
were provided for them with more than royal liberality.
Copies of the sacred books, multiplied in every form, and
adorned with the finest skill of the pencil and the sculptor
in gold and other precious materials, attested at once the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
reverence of the nation for its law, and the perfection to
which it had brought the decorative arts. The works of
strangers eminent for genius or knowledge, or even for the
singularity of their subject, were not less to be found in those
stately treasure-houses of mind. There the priest might relax
his spirit from the sublimer studies of his country by the
bold and brilliant epics of Greece, the fantastic passion and
figured beauty of the Persian poesy, or the alternate severity
and sweetness of the Indian drama—that startling union of
all lovely images of nature, the bloom and fragrance of flowers,
the hues of the Oriental heaven, and the perfumes of
isles of spice and cinnamon, with the grim and subterranean
terrors of a gigantic idolatry. There he might spread the
philosophic wing from the glittering creations of Grecian
metaphysics, to their dark and early oracles in the East; or,
stopping in his central flight, plunge into the profound of
Egyptian mystery, where science lies, like the mummy,
wrapped in a thousand folds that preserve the form, but preserve
it with the living principle gone.</p>

<p>Music, of all pleasures the most intellectual, that glorious
painting to the ear, that rich mastery of the gloomier emotions
of our nature, was studied by the priesthood with a
skill that influenced the habits of the country. How often
have my fiercest perturbations sunk at the sounds that once
filled the breezes of Judea! How often, when my brain was
burning and the blood ran through my veins like molten
brass, have I been softened down to painless tears by the
chorus from our hills, the mellow harmonies of harp and
horn blending with the voices of the youths and maidens of
Israel! How often have I in the night listened, while the
chant, ascending with a native richness to which the skill of
other nations was dissonance, floated upward like a cloud of
incense, bearing the aspirations of holiness and gratitude to
the throne of Him whom man hath not seen nor can see!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Glory of the Past</div>

<p>But those times are sunk deep in the great gulf that absorbs
the happiness and genius of man. I have since traversed
my country in its length and breadth; I have marked
with my weary feet every valley, and made my restless bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
upon every hill from Idumea to Lebanon, and from the Assyrian
sands to the waters of the Mediterranean; yet the harp
and voice were dead. I heard sounds on the hills, but they
were the cries of the villagers flying before some tyrant gatherer
of a tyrant’s tribute. I heard sounds in the midnight,
but they were the howl of the wolf and the yell of the
hyena reveling over the naked and dishonored graves, which
the infidel had given, in his scorn, to the people of my fathers.</p>

<p>But the study to which the largest expenditure of wealth
and labor was devoted was, as it ought to be, that of the
sacred books of Israel. It only makes me rebellious against
the decrees of fate to think of the incomparable richness and
immaculate character of the volumes over which I have so
often hung, and look upon the diminished and degraded exterior
in which their wisdom now lies before man. Where
are now the cases covered with jewels, the clasps of topaz and
diamond; the golden arks in which the volume of the hope
of Israel lay, too precious not to be humiliated by the contact
with even the richest treasure of earth? Where are the tissued
curtains, which hid, as in a sanctuary, that mighty roll,
too sacred to be glanced on by the casual eye? But, the
spoiler—the spoiler! The Arab, the Parthian, the human
tiger of the north, that lies crouching for a thousand years in
the sheepfold of Judah! Is there not a sword? Is there not
a judgment? Terribly will it judge the oppressor.</p>

<p>The home of my kinsmen was in the allotment of Naphtali.
The original tribe had revolted in the general schism of the
kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and was swept into the Assyrian
captivity. But on the restoration by Cyrus, fragments
of all the captive tribes returned and were suffered to resume
their lands. Misfortune wrought its moral on them; the chief
families pledged their allegiance once more to Judah, and
were exemplary in paying homage to the spirit and ordinances
of their religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Alertness of the Roman</div>

<p>We hastened through Samaria. The rancorous enmity
borne by the Samaritans to the subjects of Judah, for ages
made all intercourse between Jerusalem and the north difficult.
It was often totally interrupted by war; it was dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in peace, and the ferocious character of the population
and the bitter antipathy of the government made it to
the Jew a land of robbers.<a name="ENanchor_7" id="ENanchor_7"></a><a href="#Endnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But among the evils of the
Roman conquest was mingled this good, that it suffered no
subordinate tyranny. Its sword cut away at a blow all those
minor oppressions which make the misery of provincial life.
If the mountain robber invaded the plain, as was his custom
of old, the Roman cavalry were instantly on him with the
spear, until he took refuge in the mountains; if he resisted
in his native fastnesses, the legionaries pursued him with
torch and sword, stifled him if he remained in his cave, or
stabbed him at its entrance. If quarrels arose between villages,
the cohorts burned them to the ground; and the execution
was done with a promptitude and completeness that less
resembled the ordinary operations of war than the work of
superhuman power. The Roman knowledge of our disturbances
was instantaneous. Signals established on the hills
conveyed intelligence with the speed of light, from the remotest
corners of the land to their principal stations. Even in
our subsequent conspiracies, the first knowledge that they
had broken out was often conveyed to their partizans in the
next district by the movement of the Roman troops. Well
had they chosen the eagle for their ensign. They rushed with
the eagle’s rapidity on their victim; and when it was stretched
in blood they left the spot of vengeance, as if they had left
it on the wing. Their advance had the rapidity of the most
hurried retreat and the steadiness of the most secure triumph.
Their retreat left nothing behind but the marks of
their irresistible power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Passes through Samaria</div>

<p>All the armies of the earth have since passed before me.
I have seen the equals of the legions in courage and discipline,
and their superiors in those arms by which human life is at
the caprice of ambition. But their equals I have never seen,
in the individual fitness of the soldier for war; in his fleetness,
muscular vigor, and expertness in the use of his
weapons; in his quick adaptation to all the multiplied purposes
of the ancient campaign—from the digging of a trench
or the management of a catapult to the assault of a citadel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in his iron endurance of the vicissitudes of climate; in the
length and regularity of his marches; or in the rapidity,
boldness, and dexterity of his maneuver in the field. Yet it
is but a melancholy tribute to the valor of my countrymen to
record the Roman acknowledgment, that of all the nations
conquered by Rome Judea bore the chain with the haughtiest
dignity, and most frequently and fiercely contested the supremacy
of the sword.</p>

<p>Under that stern supremacy, the Samaritan had long
rested and flourished in exemption from the harassing cruelty
of petty war. We now passed with our long caravan unguarded,
and moved at will through fields rich with the
luxuriance of an Eastern summer, where our fathers would
have scarcely ventured but with an army. I made no resistance
to being thus led away to a region so remote from my
own. To have returned to the cities of the priests would
have but given me unceasing agony. Even the gates of Jerusalem
were to my feelings anathema. The whole fabric of
my mind had undergone a revolution. Like a man tossed at
the mercy of the tempest, I sought but a shore—and all
shores were alike to him who must be an exile forever.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Eleazar Learns of Salathiel’s Renunciation</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Journey
Continued</div>

<p>The country through which we passed, after leaving the
boundaries of Samaria—where, with all its peace, no Jew
could tread but as in the land of strangers—was new to me.
My life had been till now spent in study or in serving the
altar; and I had heard, with the usual and unwise indifference
of men devoted to books, the praise of the picturesque
and stately provinces that still remained to our people. I
was now to see for myself, and was often compelled, as we
advanced, to reproach the idle prejudice that had so long deprived
me, and might forever deprive so many of my consecrated
brethren, of an enjoyment cheering to the human heart
and full of lofty and hallowed memory to the men of
Israel. As we passed along, less traveling than wandering
at pleasure, through regions where every winding of the marble
hill or descent of the fruitful valley showed us some
sudden and romantic beauty of landscape, my kinsmen took a
natural pride in pointing out the noble features that made
Canaan a living history of Providence.<a name="ENanchor_8" id="ENanchor_8"></a><a href="#Endnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Prayer in the Valley</div>

<p>What were even the trophy-covered hills of Greece or the
monumental plains of Italy to the hills and plains where the
memorial told of the miracles and the presence of the Supreme?
“Look to that rock,” they would exclaim; “there
descended the angel of the Presence! On the summit of that
cloudy ridge stood Ezekiel, when he saw the vision of the
latter days. Look to yonder cleft in the mountains; there
fell the lightning from heaven on the Philistine.” In our
travel we reached a valley, a spot of singular beauty and
seclusion, blushing with flowers and sheeted with the olive
from its edge down to a stream that rushed brightly through
its bosom. There was no dwelling of man in it, but on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gentler slope of the declivity stood a gigantic terebinth-tree.
More than curiosity was attracted to this delicious spot, for
the laughter and talk of the caravan had instantly subsided
at the sight. All, by a common impulse, dismounted from
their horses and camels; and though it was still far from sunset,
the tents were pitched and preparations made for prayer.
The spot reminded me of the valley of Hebron, sacred to the
Jewish heart as the burial-place of Abraham, Sarah, and
Isaac. May they sleep in the bosom of the Lord! The terebinth-tree,
under which the greatest of the patriarchs sat and
talked with the angels—the fountain—the cave of Macpelah,
in which his mortal frame returned to the earth, to come again
in glory, appeared to lie before me.</p>

<p>From the day of my unspeakable crime, I had never joined
in prayer with my people. Yet, I was still a believer in the
faith of Israel. I even clung to it with the nervous violence
of one who, in a shipwreck, feels that his only hope is the
plank in his grasp, and that some more powerful hand is tearing
even that plank away. But the sight of human beings
enjoying the placid consolations of prayer had from the first
moment overwhelmed me with so keen a sense of my misfortune—the
pious gentleness of attitude and voice, the calm
uplifted hand, and low and solemn aspiration were in so deep
a contrast to the involuntary wildness and broken utterings
of a heart bound in more than adamantine chains, that I
shrank from the rebuke and groaned in solitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eleazar, the Brother of Miriam</div>

<p>I went forth into the valley, and was soon lost in its thick
vegetation. The sound of the hymn that sank down in mingled
sweetness with the murmuring of the evening air through
the leaves, and the bubbling of the brook below, alone told
me that I was near human beings. I sat upon a fragment of
turf, embroidered as never was kingly footstool and with my
hands clasped over my eyes, to remove from me all the images
of life, gave way to that visionary mood of mind in which
ideas come and pass in crowds without shape, leaving no
more impression than the drops of a sun-shower on the trees.
I had remained long in this half-dreaming confusion, and had
almost imagined myself transported to some intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
realm of being, where a part of the infliction was that of being
startled by keen flashes of light from some upper world, when
I was roused by the voice of Eleazar, the brother of Miriam,
at my side. His manly and generous countenance expressed
mingled anxiety and gladness at discovering me. “The
whole camp,” said he, “have been alarmed at your absence,
and have searched for these three hours through every part
of our day’s journey. Miriam’s distraction at length urged
me to leave her, and it was by her instinct that I took my
way down the only path hitherto unsearched, and where, indeed,
from fear or reverence of the place, few but myself
would have willingly come.” He called to an attendant, and,
sending him up the side of the valley with the tidings, we
followed slowly, for I was still feeble. As we emerged into
a more open space, the moon lying on masses of cloud, like a
queen pillowed on couches of silver, showed me, in her strong
illumination of the forest, the flashes which had added to the
bewildered pain of my reverie. While I talked with natural
animation of the splendor of the heavens, and pointed out the
lines and figures on the moon’s disk, which made it probable
that it was, like earth, a place of habitation, he suddenly
pressed my hand, and stopping, with his eyes fixed on my
face: “How,” said he, “does it happen, my friend, my
brother Salathiel?” I started, as if my name, the name of
my illustrious ancestor, direct in descent from the father of
the faithful, were an accusation. He proceeded, with an
ardent pressure of my quivering hand: “How is it to be accounted
for that you, with such contemplations and the
knowledge that gives them the dignity of science, can yet be
so habitually given over to gloom? Serious crime I will not
believe in you, though the best of us are stained. But your
character is pure; I know your nature to be too lofty for the
degenerate indulgence of the passions, and Miriam’s love for
you, a love passing that of women, is in itself a seal of virtue.
Answer me, Can the wealth, power, or influence of your
brother and his house, nay of his tribe, assist you?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Speaks of Salathiel’s Gloom</div>

<p>I was silent. He paused, and we walked on a while, without
a sound but that of our tread among the leaves; but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
mind was full, and it would have way. “Salathiel,” said he,
“you do injustice to yourself, to your wife, and to your friends.
This gloom that sits eternally on your forehead must wear
away all your uses in society; it bathes your incomparable
wife’s pillow in tears, and it disheartens, nay distresses, us
all. Answer me as one man of honor and integrity would another.
Have you been disappointed in your ambition? I
know your claims. You have knowledge surpassing that of
a multitude of your contemporaries; you have talents that
ought to be honored; your character is unimpeached and unimpeachable.
Such things ought to have already raised you
to eminence. Have you found yourself thwarted by the common
artifice of official life? Has some paltry sycophant crept
up before you by the oblique path that honor disdains? Or
have you felt yourself an excluded and marked man, merely
for the display of that manlier vigor, richer genius, and more
generous and sincere impulse of heart which to the conscious
inferiority of the rabble of understanding is gall and wormwood?
Or have you taken too deeply into your resentment
the common criminal negligence that besets common minds in
power, and makes them carelessly fling away upon incapacity,
and guiltily withhold from worth, the rewards which were
entrusted to them as a sacred deposit for the encouragement
of national ability and personal virtue?”</p>

<p>I strongly disavowed all conceptions of the kind, and assured
him that I felt neither peculiar merits nor peculiar injuries.
“I have seen too much of what ambition and worldly
success were made of, to allow hope to excite or failure to
depress me. I am even,” added I, “so far from being the
slave of that most vulgar intemperance of a deranged heart,
the diseased craving for the miserable indulgences of worldly
distinction, that would to Heaven I might never again enter
the gates of Jerusalem!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beside the Tomb of Isaiah</div>

<p>He started back in surprise. The confession had been altogether
unintended, and I looked up to see the burst of Jewish
wrath descending upon me. I saw none. My kinsman’s
fine countenance was brightened with a lofty joy. “Then
you have renounced. But no, it is yet too soon. At your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
age, with your prospects, can you have renounced the career
offered to you among the rulers of Israel?”</p>

<p>“I have renounced.”</p>

<p>“Sincerely, solemnly, upon conviction?”</p>

<p>“From the bottom of my soul, now and forever!”</p>

<p>We had reached the open space in front of the terebinth-tree
that stood in majesty, extending its stately branches over
a space cleared of all other trees, a sovereign of the forest.
In silence he led me under the shade to a small tomb, on
which the light fell with broken luster. “This,” said he, “is
the tomb of the greatest prophet on whose lips the wisdom
of Heaven ever burned. There sleeps Isaiah! There is silent
the voice that for fifty years spoke more than the
thoughts of man in the ears of a guilty people. There are
cold the hands that struck the harp of more than mortal
sounds to the glory of Him to whom earth and its kingdoms
are but as the dust of the balance. There lies the heart
which neither the desert, nor the dungeon, nor the teeth of the
lion, nor the saw of Manasseh, could tame—the denouncer of
our crimes—the scourge of our apostasy—the prophet of that
desolation which was to bow the grandeur of Judah to the
grave as the tree of the mountain in the whirlwind. Saint
and martyr, let my life be as thine; and if it be the will of
God, let my death be even as thine!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Renunciation</div>

<p>He threw himself on his knees and remained in prayer for
a time. I knelt with him, but no prayer would issue from
my heart. He at length rose, and, leading me into the moonlight,
said in a low voice: “Is there not, where the holy
sleep, a holiness in the very ground? I waive all the superstitious
feelings of the idolater, worshiping the dust of the
creature, for the King alike of all. I pass over the natural
human homage for the memory of those who have risen above
us by the great qualities of their being. But if there are
supernal influences acting upon the mind of man; if the
winged spirits that minister before the throne still descend to
earth on missions of mercy, I will believe that their loved
place is round the grave where sleeps the mortal portion of
the holy. In all our journeys to the Temple, it has been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
custom of our shattered and humiliated tribe to pause beside
this tomb, and offer up our homage to that Mightiest of the
mighty who made such men for the lights of Israel!” He
then earnestly repeated the question: “Have you abandoned
your office?” “Yes,” was the answer, “totally, with full
purpose never to resume it. In your mountains I will live
with you, and with you I will die.” Memory smote me as I
pronounced the word; the refuge of the grave was not for
me!</p>

<p>“Then,” said he, “you have relieved my spirit of a load;
you are now my more than brother.” He clasped me in his
arms. “Yes, Salathiel, I know that your high heart must
have scorned the prejudices of the Scribe and the Pharisee;
you must have seen through and loathed the smiling hypocrisy,
the rancorous bigotry, and the furious thirst of blood
that are hourly sinking us below the lowest of the heathen.
Hating the tyranny of the Roman, as I live this hour,
I would rather see the city of David inhabited by none but
the idolater, or delivered over to the curse of Babylon and
made the couch of the lion and the serpent, than see its
courts filled with those impious traitors to the spirit of the
law, those cruel extortioners under the mask of self-denial,
those malignant revelers in human torture under the name of
insulted religion, whose joy is crime, and every hour of
whose being but wearies the long-suffering of God and precipitates
the ruin of my country.”</p>

<p>He drew from his bosom and unrolled in the moonlight a
small copy of the Scriptures. “My brother,” said he, “have
you read the holy prophecies of him by whose grave we
stand?” My only answer was a smile; they were the chief
study of the priesthood. “True,” said he; “no doubt, you
have read the words of the prophet. But wisdom is known
of her children, and of them alone. Read here.”</p>

<p>I read the famous Haphtorah:<a name="ENanchor_9" id="ENanchor_9"></a><a href="#Endnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> “Who hath believed our
report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For
he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root
out of a dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and
when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
him. He is the despised and rejected of men; a man of
sorrows!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Future
Deliverer
of Judah</div>

<p>He stopped me, laying his hand on my arm; I felt his
strong nerves tremble like an infant’s. “Of whom hath the
prophet spoken?” uttered he in a voice of intense anxiety.
“Of whom? Of the Deliverer that is to restore Judah; Him
that is to come,” was my answer. “Him that <em>is to come</em>—still
<em>to come</em>?” he exclaimed. “God of heaven, must the
veil be forever on the face of Thy Israel? When shall our
darkness be light, and the chain of our spirit be broken!”
The glow and power of his countenance sank; he took the roll
with a sigh, and replaced it in his robe; then with his hands
clasped across his bosom, and his head bowed, he led our
silent way up the side of the valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Position
of the Jew</div>

<p>We soon reached the hill country, and our road passed
through what were once the allotments of Issachar, Zebulun,
and Asher, but by the Roman division was now Upper Galilee.
My health had been rapidly restored by the exercise
and the balmy air. My more incurable disease was prevented
by the journey from perhaps totally engrossing my mind. Of
all the antagonists to mental depression, traveling is the most
vigorous; not the flight from place to place, as if evil were to
be outrun, nor the enclosure of the weary of life in some narrow
vehicle that adds fever and pestilence to heaviness of
heart, but the passing at our ease through the open air and
bright landscape of a new country. To me the novelty and
loveliness of the land were combined with the memory of
the most striking events in human record. I had, too, the
advantage of a companionship which would have enlivened
travel through the wilderness—brave and cheerful men and
women on whose minds and forms nature laid her finest
stamp of beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Semitic Type of Beauty</div>

<p>The name of Jew is now but another title for humiliation.
Who that sees that fallen thing, with his countenance bent to

through the proud streets of Europe in some degrading occupation,
and clothed in the robes of the beggared and the despised,
could imagine the bold figures and gallant bearing of
the lion-hunters, with whom, in the midst of shouts and songs
of careless joy, I spurred my barb up the mountain-paths of
Galilee! Yet, fallen as he is, the physiognomy of the Jew
retains a share of its original beauty, sufficient to establish
the claim of the people to have been the handsomest race on
earth. Individuals of superior comeliness may often be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
among the multitudes of mankind. But no nation, nor distinct
part of any nation, can rival an equal number of the unhappy
exiles of Israel in the original impress of that hand
which made man only a little lower than the angels. To
conceive the Jew as he was, we should picture the stern and
watchful contraction of the dark eye expanded; the fierce and
ridgy brow lowering no more; the lip no longer gathered in
habitual fear or scorn; the cheek no longer sallow with want
or pining, and the whole man elevated by the returning consciousness
that he has a rank among nations. All his deformities
have been the birth of his misfortunes. What beauty
can we demand from the dungeon? What dignity of aspect
from the hewers of wood and drawers of water for mankind?
Where shall we seek the magnificent form and illumined
countenance of the hero and the sage—from the heart cankered
by the chain, from the plundered, the enslaved, the
persecuted of two thousand years?</p>

<p>Of the daughters of my country I have never seen the
equals in beauty. Our blood was Arab, softened down by
various changes of state and climate, till it was finally brought
to perfection in the most genial air and the most generous
soil of the globe. The vivid features of the Arab countenance,
no longer attenuated by the desert, assumed, in the
plenty of Egypt, that fulness and fine proportion which still
belongs to the dwellers by the Nile; but the true change was
on our entrance into the promised land. Peace, the possession
of property, days spent among the cheerful and healthful
occupations of rural life, are in themselves productive of the
finer developments of the human form—a form whose natural
tendency is to beauty. But our nation had an additional and
an unshared source of nobleness of aspect: it was free.</p>

<p>The state of man in the most unfettered republics of the
ancient world was slavery compared with the magnanimous
and secure establishment of the Jewish commonwealth. During
the three hundred golden years, from Moses to Samuel—before
we were given over to the madness of innovation for
our sins, and the demand of an earthly diadem—the Jew was
free in the loftiest sense of freedom; free to do all good; restricted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
only from evil; every man pursuing the unobstructed
course pointed out by his genius or his fortune; every man
protected by laws inviolable, or whose violation was instantly
visited with punishment by the Eternal Sovereign alike of
ruler and people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freedom,
Twin Sister
of Virtue</div>

<p>Freedom! twin sister of Virtue, thou brightest of all the
spirits that descended in the train of Religion from the throne
of God; thou that leadest up man again to the early glories
of his being; angel, from the circle of whose presence happiness
spreads like the sunrise over the darkness of the land;
at the waving of whose scepter, knowledge and peace and
fortitude and wisdom descend upon the wing; at the voice
of whose trumpet the more than grave is broken and slavery
gives up her dead,—when shall I see thy coming? When shall
I hear thy summons upon the mountains of my country, and
rejoice in the regeneration and glory of the sons of Judah? I
have traversed nations, and, as I set my foot upon their
boundary, I have said, “Freedom is not here!” I saw the
naked hill, the morass steaming with death, the field covered
with weedy fallow, the sickly thicket encumbering the land;
I saw the still more infallible signs, the downcast visage, the
form degraded at once by loathsome indolence and desperate
poverty; the peasant, cheerless and feeble in his field, the
wolfish robber, the population of the cities crowded into huts
and cells, with pestilence for their fellow; I saw the contumely
of man to man, the furious vindictiveness of popular
rage, and I pronounced at the moment, “This people is not
free!”</p>

<p>In the various republics of heathen antiquity, the helot
living under the yoke of oppression, and the born bondsman
lingering out life in thankless toil, at once put to flight all
conceptions of freedom. In the midst of altars fuming to
liberty, of harangues glowing with the most pompous protestations
of scorn for servitude, of crowds inflated with the presumption
that they disdained a master, the eye was insulted
with the perpetual chain. The temple of Liberty was built
upon the dungeon. Rome came, and unconsciously avenged
the insulted name of freedom; the master and the slave were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
bowed down together, and the dungeon was made the common
dwelling of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where Freedom
Reigned in
Name Alone</div>

<p>In the Italian republics of after ages, I saw the vigor that,
living in the native soil of empire, has always sprung up on
the first call. The time has changed since Italy poured its
legions over the world. The volcano was now sleeping; yet
the fire still burned within its womb, and threw out in its invisible
strength the luxuriant qualities of the land of power.
The innate Roman passion for sovereignty was no longer to
find its triumphs in the field; it rushed up the paths of a
loftier and more solid glory, with a speed and a strength that
left mankind wondering below. The arts, adventure, legislation,
literature in all its shapes, of the subtle, the rich, and
the sublime, were the peaceful triumphs whose laurels will
entwine the Italian brow when the wreath of the Cæsars is
remembered but as a badge of national folly and individual
crime.</p>

<p>But those republics knew freedom only by name. All,
within a few years from their birth, had abandoned its living
principles—justice, temperance, and truth. I saw the soldiery
of neighbor cities marching to mutual devastation, and I
said, “Freedom is not here!” I saw abject privation mingled
with boundless luxury; in the midst of the noblest works of
architecture, the hovel; in the pomps of citizens covered with
cloth of gold, gazing groups of faces haggard with beggary
and sin; I saw the sold tribunal, the inexorable state prison,
the established spy, the protected assassin, the secret torture;
and I said, “Freedom is not here!” The pageant filled the
streets with more than kingly blazonry, the trumpets flourished,
the multitude shouted, the painter covered the walls
with immortal emblems, in honor of Freedom; I pointed to
the dungeon, the rack, and the dagger! Bitterer and deeper
sign than all, I pointed to the exile of exiles, the broken
man, whom even the broken trample, of all the undone the
most undone—my outcast brother in the blood of Abraham!</p>

<p>I am not about to be his defender; I am not regardless of
his tremendous crime; I can not stand up alone against the
voice of universal man, which has cried out that thus it shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
be; but I say it from the depths of my soul, and as I hope
for rest to my miseries, that I never saw freedom survive in
that land which loved to smite the Jew!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Women
of Judea</div>

<p>I saw one republic more, the mightiest and the last; for the
justice of Heaven on the land, the most terrible; for the mercy
of Heaven to mankind, the briefest in its devastation. But
there all was hypocrisy that was not horror; the only equal
rights were those of the equal robber; the sacred figure of
Liberty veiled its face; and the offering on its violated shrine
was the spoil of honor, bravery, and virtue.</p>

<p>The daughters of our nation, sharing in the rights of its
sons, bore the lofty impression that virtuous freedom always
stamps on the human features. But they had the softer
graces of their sex in a degree unequaled in the ancient
world. While the woman of the East was immured behind
bolts and bars, from time immemorial a prisoner, and the
woman of the West was a toy, a savage, or a slave, our wives
and maidens enjoyed the intercourses of society, which their
talents were well calculated to cheer and adorn. They were
skilled on the harp; their sweet voices were tuned to the richest
strains of earth; they were graceful in the dance; the
writings of our bards were in their hands; and what nation
ever possessed such illustrious founts of thought and virtue!
But there was another and a still higher ground for that
peculiar expression which makes their countenance still
lighten before me, as something of more than mortal beauty.
The earliest consciousness of every Jewish woman was, that
she might, in the hand of Providence, be the sacred source
of a blessing and a glory that throws all imagination into the
shade; that of her might be born a Being, to whom earth and
all its kings should bow—the more than man! the more than
angel! veiling for a little time His splendors in the form of
man, to raise Israel to the scepter of the world, to raise that
world into a renewed paradise, and then to resume His original
glory, and be Sovereign, Creator, God—all in all!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Passing Glory of Judah’s Daughters</div>

<p>This consciousness, however dimmed, was never forgotten;
the misfortunes of Judah never breaking the strong link by
which we held to the future. The reliance on predictions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
perpetually renewed, and never more vividly renewed than in
the midst of our misfortunes—a reliance commemorated in all
the great ceremonies of our nation, in our worship, in our
festivals, in every baptism, in every marriage—must have
filled a large space in the susceptible mind of woman.
And what but the mind forms the countenance? And what
must have been the molding of that most magnificent and
elevating of all hopes, for centuries, on the most plastic and
expressive features in the world?</p>

<p>Sacredly reserved from intermixture with the blood of the
stranger, the hope was spread throughout Israel. The line
of David was pure, but its connection had shot widely
through the land. It was like the Indian tree taking root
through a thousand trees. Every Jewish woman might hope
to be the living altar on which the Light to lighten the Gentiles
was to descend! The humblest might be the blessed
among women—the mother of the Messiah! But all is gone!
Ages of wandering, wo, poverty, contumely, and mixture of
blood have done their work of evil. The loveliness may
partially remain, but the glory of Judah’s daughters is no
more.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Loss of a Life</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A Wolf Chase
among the
Mountains</div>

<p>We continued ascending through the defiles of the mountain
range of Carmel. The gorges of the hills gave us alternate
glimpses of Lower Galilee, and of the great sea which
lay bounding the western horizon with azure. The morning
breezes from the land, now in the full vegetation of the rapid
spring of Palestine, scarcely ceased to fill the heavens with
fragrance, when the sea-wind sprang up and, with the coolness
and purity of a gush of fountain-waters, renewed the
spirit of life in the air and made the whole caravan forget its
fatigue. Our bold hunters spurred down the valleys and up
the hills with the wildness of superfluous vigor, tossed their
lances into the air, sang their mountain songs, and shouted
the cries of the chase and the battle.</p>

<p>On one eventful day a wolf was started from its covert, and
every rein was let loose in a moment; nothing could stop the
fearlessness of the riders or exhaust the fire of the steeds.
The caravan, coming on slowly with the women and children
and lengthening out among the passes, was forgotten. I
scorned to be left behind, and followed my daring companions
at full speed. The wolf led us a long chase; and on the summit
of a rock, still blazing in the sunlight like a beacon, while
the plain was growing dim, he fought his last fight, and, transfixed
with a hundred lances, died the death of a hero. But
the spot which we had reached supplied statelier contemplations:
we were on the summit of Mount Tabor; the eye wandered
over the whole glory of the Land of Promise. To the
south extended the mountains of Samaria, their peaked summits
glowing in the sun with the colored brilliancy of a chain
of gems. To the east lay the lake of Tiberias, a long line of
purple. Northward, like a thousand rainbows, ascended, lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
by the western flame, the mountains of Gilboa, those memorable
hills on which the spear of Saul was broken, and the first
curse of our obstinacy was branded upon us in the blood of
our first king. Closing the superb circle, and soaring into the
very heavens, ascended step by step the Antilibanus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
View from
Mount Tabor</div>

<p>Of all the sights that nature offers to the eye and mind of
man, mountains have always stirred my strongest feelings. I
have seen the ocean when it was turned up from the bottom
by tempest, and noon was like night with the conflict of the
billows and the storm that tore and scattered them in mist
and foam across the sky. I have seen the desert rise around
me, and calmly, in the midst of thousands uttering cries of
horror and paralyzed by fear, have contemplated the sandy
pillars coming like the advance of some gigantic city of conflagration
flying across the wilderness, every column glowing
with intense fire and every blast with death; the sky vaulted
with gloom, the earth a furnace. But with me, the mountain—in
tempest or in calm, whether the throne of the thunder
or with the evening sun painting its dells and declivities in
colors dipped in heaven—has been the source of the most absorbing
sensations: <em>there</em> stands magnitude, giving the instant
impression of a power above man—grandeur that defies decay—antiquity
that tells of ages unnumbered—beauty that the
touch of time makes only more beautiful—use exhaustless for
the service of man—strength imperishable as the globe; the
monument of eternity—the truest earthly emblem of that ever-living,
unchangeable, irresistible Majesty by whom and for
whom all things were made!</p>

<p>I was gazing on the Antilibanus, and peopling its distant
slopes with figures of other worlds ascending and descending,
as in the patriarch’s dream, when I was roused by the trampling
steed of one of my kinsmen returning with the wolf’s
head, the trophy of his superior prowess, at his saddle-bow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jubal’s Tribal Pride</div>

<p>“So,” said he, “you disdained to share the last battle of
that dog of the Galilees? But we shall show you something
better worth the chase when we reach home. The first snow
that drives the lions down from Lebanon, or the first hot wind
that sends the panthers flying before it from Assyria, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
have all our villages up in arms; every man who can draw a
bow or throw a lance will be on the mountains; and then
we shall give you the honors of a hunter in exchange for your
philosophy.” He uttered this with a jovial laugh, and a hand
grasping mine with the grip of a giant. “Yet,” said he, and
a shade passed over his brow, “I wish we had something better
to do; you must not look down upon Jubal, and the tribe
of your brother Eleazar, as mere rovers after wolves and panthers.”<a name="ENanchor_10" id="ENanchor_10"></a><a href="#Endnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>I willingly declared my respect for the intrepidity and dexterity
which the mountain life insured. I applauded its
health, activity, and cheerfulness. “Yet,” interrupted Jubal
sternly, “what can be done while those Romans are everywhere
round us?” He stopped short, reined up his horse
with a sudden force that made the animal spring from the
ground, flung his lance high in air, caught it in the fall, and
having thus relieved his indignation, returned to discuss with
me the chances of a Roman war. “Look at those,” said he,
pointing to the horsemen who were now bounding across the
declivities to rejoin the caravan; “their horses are flame, their
bodies are iron, and their souls would be both if they had a
leader.” “Eleazar is brave,” I replied. “Brave as his own
lance,” was the answer; “no warmer heart, wiser head, or
firmer arm moves at this hour within the borders of the land.
But he despairs.” “He knows,” said I, “the Roman power
and the Jewish weakness.”</p>

<p>“Both—both, too well!” was the reply. “But he forgets
the power that is in the cause of a people fighting for their
law and for their rights, in the midst of glorious remembrances,
nay, in the hope of a help greater than that of the
sword. Look at the tract beyond those linden-trees.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jubal, the Jewish Warrior</div>

<p>He pointed to a broken extent of ground, darkly distinguishable
from the rest of the plain. “On that ground, to
this moment wearing the look of a grave, was drawn up the
host of Sisera; under that ground is its grave. By this
stone,” and he struck his lance on a rough pillar defaced by
time, “stood Deborah the prophetess, prophesying against the
thousands and tens of thousands of the heathen below. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
this hill were drawn up the army of Barak, as a drop in the
ocean compared with the infidel multitudes. They were the
ancestors of the men whom you now see trooping before you;
the men of Naphtali, with their brothers of Zebulun. On
this spot they gathered their might like the storm of heaven.
From this spot they poured down like its whirlwinds and
lightnings upon the taunting enemy. God was their leader.
They rushed upon the nine hundred scythed chariots, upon
the mailed cavalry, upon the countless infantry. Of all, but
one escaped from the plain of Jezreel, and that one only to
perish in his flight by the degradation of a woman’s hand!”
He wheeled round his foaming horse, and appealed to me.
“Are the Roman legions more numerous than that host of the
dead? Is Israel now less valiant, less wronged, or less indignant?
Shall no prophet arise among us again? Shall it not
be sung again, as it was then sung to the harps of Israel:
‘Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
unto the death in the high places of the field’?”</p>

<p>I looked with involuntary wonder at the change wrought
in him by those proud recollections. The rude and jovial
hunter was no more; the Jewish warrior stood before me,
filled with the double impulse of generous scorn of the oppression
and of high dependence on the fate of his nation. His
countenance was ennobled, his form seemed to dilate, his voice
grew sonorous as a trumpet. A sudden burst of the declining
sun broke upon his figure, and threw a sheet of splendor across
the scarlet turban, the glittering tunic, the spear-point lifted
in the strenuous hand, the richly caparisoned front and sanguine
nostrils of his impatient charger. A Gentile would
have worshiped him as the tutelar genius of war. I saw in
him but the man that our history and our law were ordained
beyond all others to have made—the native strength of character
raised into heroism by the conviction of a guiding and
protecting Providence.</p>

<p>The conversation was not forgotten on either side; and it
bore fruit, fearful fruit, in time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Plunge Down the Precipice</div>

<p>We had reached on our return a commanding point, from
which we looked into the depths already filling with twilight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and through whose blue vapors the caravan toiled slowly
along, like a wearied fleet in some billowy sea. Suddenly
a tumult was perceived below; shouts of confusion and terror
rose, and the whole caravan was seen scattering in all directions
through the passes. For the first moment we thought
that it had been attacked by the mountain robbers. We
grasped our lances, and galloped down the side of the hill to
charge them, when we were stopped at once by a cry from
the ridge which we had just left. It struck through my heart—the
voice was Miriam’s. To my unspeakable horror, I saw
her dromedary, mad with fear and pouring blood, rush along
the edge of the precipice. I saw the figure clinging to his
neck. The light forsook my eyes, and but for the grasp of
Jubal, I must have fallen to the ground. His voice aroused
me. When I looked round again, the shouts had died, the
troop had disappeared—it seemed all a dream!</p>

<p>But, again, the shouts came doubling upon the wind, and
far as the eye could pierce through the dusk, I saw the white
robe of Miriam flying along like a vapor. I threw the reins
on my horse’s neck—I roused him with my voice—I rushed
with the fearlessness of despair through the hills—I overtook
the troop—I outstripped them—still the vision flew before
me. At length it sank. The dromedary had plunged down
the precipice, a depth of hideous darkness. A torrent roared
below. I struck in the spur to follow. My horse wheeled
round on the edge; while I strove to force him to the leap,
my kinsmen came up, with Eleazar at their head. Bold as
they were, they all recoiled from the frightful depth. Even
in that wild moment I had time to feel that this was but the
beginning of my inflictions, and that I was to be the ruin of
all that belonged to me. In consciousness unspeakable, I
sprang from my startled steed, and before a hand could
check me I plunged in. A cry of astonishment and horror
rang in my ears as I fell. The roar of waters was then
around me. I struggled with the torrent, gasped, and heard
no more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spring of a Wolf</div>

<p>This desperate effort saved the life of Miriam. We were
found apparently dead, clasped in each other’s arms, at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
distance down the stream. The plunge had broken the band
by which she was fixed on the saddle. She floated, and we
were thrown together by the eddy. After long effort, we
were restored. But the lamentations of my matchless wife
were restrained beside my couch, only to burst forth when
she was alone. We had lost our infant!</p>

<p>The chase of the wolves in the mountain had driven them
across the march of the caravan. One of those savages sprang
upon the flank of the dromedary. The animal, in the agony
of its wounds, burst away; its proverbial fleetness baffled pursuit,
and it was almost fortunate that it at length bounded
over the precipice, as, in the mountain country, its precious
burden must have perished by the lion or by famine. Miriam
held her babe with the strong grasp of a mother, but in the
torrent that grasp was dissolved. All our search was in
vain. My wife wept; but I had in her rescued my chief
treasure on earth, and was partially consoled by the same
deep feeling which pronounced that I might have been punished
by the loss of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Discontent</div>

<p>Let me hasten through some years.<a name="ENanchor_11" id="ENanchor_11"></a><a href="#Endnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The sunshine of life
was gone; in all my desire to conform to the habits of my
new career, I found myself incapable of contentment. But
the times, that had long resembled the stagnation of a lake,
were beginning to be shaken. Rome herself, the prey of conspiracy,
gradually held her foreign scepter with a feebler
hand. Gaul and Germany were covered with gathering
clouds, and their flashes were answered from the Asiatic
hills. With the relaxation of the paramount authority, the
chain of subordinate oppression, as always happens, was made
tighter. As the master was enfeebled, the menials were less
in awe; and Judea rapidly felt what must be the evils of a
military government without the strictness of military discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Painful Recollections</div>

<p>I protest against being charged with ambition. But I had
a painful sense of the guilt of suffering even such powers as
I might possess to waste away, without use to some part of
mankind. I was weary of the utter unproductiveness of the
animal enjoyments, in which I saw the multitude round me
content to linger into old age. I longed for an opportunity
of contributing my mite to the solid possessions by which
posterity is wiser, happier, or purer than the generation before
it—some trivial tribute to that mighty stream of time
which ought to go on, continually bringing richer fertility as
it flowed. I was not grieved by the change which I saw overshadowing
the gorgeous empire of Rome. My unspeakable
crime may have thrown a deeper tinge on those contemplations.
But by a singular fatality, and perhaps for the increase
of my punishment, I was left for long periods in
each year to the common impressions of life. The wisdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which even my great misfortune might have forced upon me,
was withheld; and the being who, in the conviction of his
mysterious destiny, must have looked upon earth and its pursuits
as man looks upon the labors and the life of flies—as
atoms in the sunshine—as measureless emptiness and trifling—was
given over to be disturbed by the impulses of generations
on whose dust he was to sit, and to see other generations
rise round him, themselves to sink alike into dust, while
he still sat an image of endurance, torturing, but imperishable.</p>

<p>There was a season in each year when those recollections
returned with overwhelming vividness. If all other knowledge
of the approach of the Passover could have escaped me,
there were signs, fearful signs, that warned me of that hour
of my wo. A periodic dread of the sight of man, a sudden
sense of my utter separation from the interests of the transitory
beings around me, wild dreams, days of immovable abstraction,
yet filled with the breathing picture of all that I
had done on the day of my guilt in Jerusalem, rose before
me with such intense reality that I lived again through the
scene. The successive progress of my crime—the swift and
stinging consciousness of condemnation—the flash of fearful
knowledge, that showed me futurity—all were felt with the
keenness of a being from whom his fleshly nature has been
stripped away and the soul bared to every visitation of pain.
I stood, like a disembodied spirit, in suffering.</p>

<p>Yet I could not be restrained from following my tribe on
their annual progress to the Holy City. To see from afar the
towers of the Temple was with me like a craving for life—but
I never dared to set my foot within its gates. On some
pretense or other, and sometimes through real powerlessness,
arising from the conflict of my heart, I lingered behind, yet
within the distance from which the city could be seen. There
among the precipices I wandered through the day, listening
to the various uproar of the mighty multitude, or wistfully
catching some echo of the hymns in the Temple—sounds that
stole from my eye many a tear—till darkness fell, the city
slumbered, and the blast of the Roman trumpets, as they divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the night, reminded me of the fallen glories of my
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Beside
the Lake</div>

<p>In one of those wanderings I had followed the courses of
the Kedron, which, from a brook under the walls of Jerusalem,
swells to a river on its descent to the Dead Sea. The
blood of the sacrifices from the conduits of the altars curdled
on its surface and stained the sands purple. It looked like
a wounded vein from the mighty heart above. I still strayed
on, wrapped in sad forebodings of the hour when its stains
might be of more than sacrifice, until I found myself on the
edge of the lake. Who has ever seen that black expanse
without a shudder? There were the engulfed cities. Around
it life was extinct—no animal bounded—no bird hovered.
The distant rushing of the Jordan, as it forced its current
through the heavy waters, or the sigh of the wind through
the reeds, alone broke the silence of this mighty grave. Of
the melancholy objects of nature, none is more depressing
than a large expanse of stagnant waters. No gloom of forest
or wildness of mountain is so overpowering as this dreary,
unrelieved flatness—the marshy border, the sickly vegetation
of the shore, the leaden color which even the sky above it
wears, tinged by its sepulchral atmosphere. But the waters
before me were not left to the dreams of a saddened fancy—they
were a sepulcher. Myriads of human beings lay beneath
them, entombed in sulfurous beds. The wrath of Heaven
had been there! The day of destruction seemed to pass again
before my eyes, as I lay gazing upon those sullen depths. I
saw them once more a plain covered with richness; cities glittering
in the morning sun; multitudes pouring out from their
gates to sports and festivals; the land exulting with life and
luxuriance: Then a cloud gathered above. I heard the
thunder: it was answered by the earthquake. Fire burst
from the skies: it was answered by a thousand founts of fire
spouting from the plain. The distant hills blazed and threw
volcanic showers over the cities. Round them was a tide of
burning bitumen. The earthquake heaved again. All sank
into the gulf. I heard the roar of the distant waters. They
rushed into the bed of fire; the doom was done; the cities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the plain were gone down to the blackness of darkness forever!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Meeting</div>

<p>I was idly watching the bursts of suffocating vapor, that
shoot up at intervals from the rising masses of bitumen, when
I was startled by a wild laugh and wilder figure beside me.
I sprang to my feet, and prepared for defense with my poniard.
The figure waved its hand, in sign to sheathe the unnecessary
weapon, and said, in a tone strange and melancholy:
“You are in my power, but I do not come to injure you. I
have been contemplating your countenance for some time; I
have seen your disturbed features—your wringing hands—your
convulsed form—are you even as I am?”</p>

<p>The voice was singularly mild; yet I never heard a sound
that so keenly pierced my brain. The speaker was of the
tallest stature of man—every sinew and muscle exhibiting gigantic
strength; yet with the symmetry of a Greek statue.
But his countenance was the true wonder—it was of the finest
mold of manly beauty; the contour was Greek, though the hue
was Syrian—yet the dark tinge of country gave way at times
to a corpse-like paleness. I had full leisure for the view, for
he stood gazing on me without a word and I remained fixed
on my defense. At length he said: “Put up that poniard!
You could no more hurt me than you could resist me. Look
here!” He wrenched a huge mass of rock from the ground
and whirled it far into the lake, as if it had been a pebble. I
gazed with speechless astonishment. “Yes,” pursued the
figure, “they throw me into their prisons—they lash me—they
stretch me on the rack—they burn my flesh.” As he
spoke he flung aside his robe and showed his broad breast
covered with scars. “Short-sighted fools! little they know
him who suffers or him who commands. If it were not my
will to endure, I could crush my tormentors as I crush an
insect. They chain me, too,” said he with a laugh of scorn.
He drew out the arm which had been hitherto wrapped in his
robe. It was loaded with heavy links of iron. He grasped
one of them in his hand, twisted it off with scarcely an effort,
and flung it up a sightless distance in the air. “Such are
bars and bolts to me! When my time is come to suffer, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
submit to be tortured! When that time is past, I tear away
their fetters, burst their dungeons, and walk forth trampling
their armed men.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Craves Power</div>

<p>I sheathed the dagger. “Does this strength amaze you?”
said the being; “look to yonder dust”—and he pointed to a
cloud of sand that came flying along the shore. “I could
outstrip that whirlwind; I could plunge unhurt into the
depths of that sea; I could ascend that mountain swifter
than the eagle; I could ride that thunder-cloud.”</p>

<p>As he threw himself back, gazing upon the sky with his
grand form buoyant with vigor and his arm raised, he looked
like one to whom height or depth could offer no obstacle.
His mantle flew out along the blast, like the unfurling of a
mighty wing. There was something in his look and voice
that gave irresistible conviction to his words. Conscious
mastery was in all about him. I should not have felt surprise
to see him spring up into the clouds!</p>

<p>My mind grew inflamed by his presence. My blood burned
with sensations for which language was no name—a thirst
of power—a scorn of earth—a proud and fiery longing for
the command of the hidden mysteries of nature. I felt as
the great ancestor of mankind might have felt when the
tempter told him, “Ye shall be even as gods.”</p>

<p>“Give me your power!” I exclaimed; “the world to me is
worthless; with man all my ties are broken; let me live in
the desert, and be even as you are; give me your power.”
“My power?” he repeated, with a ghastly laugh that was
echoed round the wilderness by what seemed voices innumerable
until it died away in a distant groan. “Look on this
forehead!”—he threw back the corner of his mantle. A furrow
was drawn round his brow, covered with gore, and gaping
like a fresh wound. “Here,” cried he, “sat the diadem.
I was Epiphanes.”<a name="ENanchor_12" id="ENanchor_12"></a><a href="#Endnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Which Antiochus Promises</div>

<p>“You, Antiochus! the tyrant—the persecutor—the spoiler—the
accursed of Israel!” I bounded backward in sudden
horror. I saw before me one of those spirits of the evil
dead who are allowed from time to time to reappear on earth
in the body, whether of the dead or the living. For some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
cause that none could unfold, Judea had been, within the last
few years, haunted by those beings more than for centuries.
Strange rites, dangerously borrowed from the idolaters, were
resorted to for our relief from this new terror: the pulling of
the mandrake at the eclipse of the moon—incantations—midnight
offerings—the root of Baaras, that was said to flash
flame and kill the animal that drew it from the ground. Our
Sadducees and skeptics, wise in their own conceit, declared
that possession was but a human disease, a wilder insanity.
But, with the range and misery of madness, there were tremendous
distinctions, which raised it beyond all the ravages of
the hurt mind or the afflicted frame—the look, the language,
the horror, of the possessed were above man. They defied
human restraint; they lived in wildernesses where the very
serpents died; the fiery sun of the East, the inclemency of
the fiercest winter, had no power to break down their strength.
But they had stronger signs. They spoke of things to which
the wisdom of the wisest was folly; they told of the remotest
future, with the force of prophecy; they gave glimpses of a
knowledge brought from realms of being inaccessible to living
man; last and loftiest sign, they did homage to HIS coming,
whom a cloud of darkness, the guilty and impenetrable darkness
of the heart, had veiled from my unhappy nation. But
their worship was terror—they believed and trembled.</p>

<p>“Power,” said the possessed, and his large and unmoving
eyes seemed lighting up with fire from within; “power you
shall have, and hate it; wealth you shall have, and hate it;
life you shall have, and hate it; yet you shall know the
heights and depths of man. You shall be the worm among
a nation of worms; you shall be steeped in ruin to the lips;
you shall undergo the bitterness of death, until——” His
brow writhed; he gnashed his teeth, and convulsively sprang
from the ground, as if an arrow had shot through him.</p>

<p>The current of his thoughts suddenly changed. Things
above man were not to be uttered to the ear unopened by the
grave. “Come,” said he, “son of misfortune, emblem of the
nation that living shall die, and dying shall live; that, trampled
by all, shall trample upon all; that, bleeding from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
thousand wounds, shall be unhurt; that, beggared, shall wield
the wealth of nations; that, without a name, shall sway the
councils of kings; that, without a city, shall inhabit in all
kingdoms; that, scattered like the dust, shall be bound together
like the rock; that, perishing by the sword, by the
chain, by famine, by fire, shall yet be imperishable, unnumbered,
glorious as the stars of heaven.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Overpowered</div>

<p>Overwhelmed with sensations, rushing in a flood through my
heart, I had cast myself upon the ground; the flashing of the
fiery eye before me consumed my blood; and, fainting, I lay
with my face upon the sand. But his words were deeply
heard; with every sound of his searching voice they struck
into my soul. He grasped me; and I was lifted up like an
infant in his clutch. “Come,” said he, “and see what is reserved
for you and for your people.”</p>

<p>He darted forward with a speed that took away my breath;
he ran—he bounded—he flew. “Now, behold,” he uttered
in an accent as composed as if he had not moved a limb.
I looked, and found myself on one of the hills close to the
great southern gate of Jerusalem. Years had passed since I
ventured so nigh. But I now gazed on the city of pomp and
beauty with an involuntary wonder that I could have ever
deserted a scene so lovely and so loved.</p>

<p>It was the twilight of a summer evening. Tower and wall
lay bathed in a sea of purple; the Temple rose from its center
like an island of light; the host of heaven came riding up
the blue fields above; the sounds of day died in harmony.
All was the sweetness, calmness, and splendor of a vision
painted in the clouds.</p>

<p>“There,” said the possessed, “I was once master, conqueror,
avenger; yet I was but the instrument to punish your
furious dissensions—your guilty abandonment of the law of
your leader—your more than Gentile apostasy from the worship
of Him who is to be worshiped with more than the
blood of bulls and goats. A power hidden from my idolatrous
eyes went before me and broke down the courage of
your people. I marched through your gates on the neck of
the godless warrior; I plundered the wealth of your rich men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
made worldly by their wealth; I slew your priesthood, already
the betrayers of their altar; I overthrew your places
of worship, already defiled; I covered the ruins with the
blood of swine; I raised idols in the sanctuary; I bore away
the golden vessels of the Temple, and gave them to the insult
of the Syrian; I slew your males, I made captives of your
women; I abolished your sacrifices, and pronounced in my
hour of blasphemy that within the walls of Jerusalem the
flame should never again be kindled to the Supreme. The deed
was mine, but the cause was the iniquity of your people.”</p>

<p>The history of devastation roused in me those feelings native
to the Jew by which I had been taught to look with abhorrence
on the devastator.</p>

<p>“Let me be gone,” I exclaimed, struggling from his grasp.
“Strange and terrible being, let me hear no more this outrage
on God and man. I am guilty, too guilty, in having listened
to you for a moment.”</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon my brow, and I felt my strength dissolve
at the touch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Prophecy
of the Future</div>

<p>“Go,” said he, “but first be a witness of the future. A
fiercer destroyer than Epiphanes shall come, to punish a darker
crime than ever stained your forefathers. A destruction shall
come to which the past was the sport of children. Tower and
wall, citadel and temple, shall be dust. The sword shall do
its work—the chain shall do its work—the flame shall do its
work. Bad spirits shall rejoice; good spirits shall weep; Israel
shall be clothed in sackcloth and ashes for a time, impenetrable
by a created eye. The world shall exult, trample,
scorn, and slay. Blindness, madness, and misery shall be
the portion of the people. Now, behold!”</p>

<p>He stood, with his arm stretched out toward the Temple.
All before me was tranquillity itself; night had suddenly
fallen deeper than usual; the stars had been wrapped in
clouds, that yet gathered without a wind; a faint tinge of
light from the summit of Mount Moriah, the gleam of the
never-extinguished altar of the daily sacrifice, alone marked
the central court of the Temple. I turned from the almost
death-like stillness of the scene, with a look of involuntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
disbelief, to the face of my fearful guide; even in the deep
darkness every feature of it was strangely visible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Beginning
of Evil</div>

<p>A low murmur from the city caught my ear; it rapidly grew
loud, various, wild; it was soon intermingled with the clash of
arms. Trumpets now rang; I recognized the charging shout
of the Romans; I heard the tumultuous roar of my countrymen
in return. The darkness was converted into light;
torches blazed along the battlements; the Tower of Antonia,
the Roman citadel, with its massy bulwarks and immense altitude,
rose from a tossing expanse of flame below like a colossal
funeral-pile; I could see on its summit the alarm, the
rapid signals, the hasty snatching up of spear and shield, the
confusion of the garrison which that night’s vengeance was
to offer up on the pile. The roar of battle rose, it deepened
into cries of agony, it swelled again into furious exultation——</p>

<p>I thought of my countrymen butchered by some new caprice
of power; of my kinsmen, perhaps at that instant involved in
the massacre; of the city, every stone and beam of which was
dear to my embittered heart, given up to the vengeance of the
idolater! The prediction of its ruin was in my ears, and I
longed to perish with my tribe. I panted with every shout
of the battle; every new sheet of flame that rolled upward
from the burning houses fevered me; I longed to rush into
the uproar with the speed of the whirlwind. But the terrible
hand was still upon my forehead, and I was feeble as a
broken reed. “Behold,” said the possessed, “those are but
the beginnings of evil.” I felt a sudden return of my
strength; I looked up; he was gone!</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Romans Driven from the Holy City</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A Scene of
Desolation</div>

<p>I plunged into the valley, and found it filled with fugitives,
incapable from terror of giving me any account of the
conflict. Women and children, hastily thrown on the mules
and camels, continued to pour through the country. The
road wound through hills, and tho sometimes approaching
near enough to the walls to be illuminated by the blaze of the
torches and beacons, yet, from its general darkness and intricacy,
I was left to make my way by the sounds of the struggle.
But I was quickly within reach of ample evidence of
what was doing in that night of havoc. The bend of the
road, from which the first view of the grand portico was seen,
had been the rallying-point for the multitude driven out by the
unexpected resistance of the garrison. The tide of fight had
thence ebbed and flowed, and I found the spot covered with
the dead and dying. In my haste, I fell over one of the
wounded; he groaned and prayed me for a cup of water. I
knew the voice of Jairus, one of the boldest of our mountaineers,
and bore him to the hillside that he might not be trampled
by the crowd. He thanked me, and said: “If you be a
man of Israel, fly to Eleazar. Take this spear—another moment
may be too late.” I seized the spear and sprang forward.</p>

<p>The multitude had repelled the Romans and forced them up
the broad central street of the city. But a reenforcement from
the Tower of Antonia had joined the troops, and were driving
back the victors with ruinous disorder. I heard the war-cries
of the tribes as they called to the rescue, and the charge,
“Onward, Judah!” “Ho, for Zebulun!” “Glory to Naphtali!”
I thought of the times of Jewish triumph, and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
before me the warriors of the Maccabees. Nerved with new
sensations, the strong instincts which make the war-horse
paw the ground at the trumpet and make men rush headlong
upon death, heightened by the stinging recollections of our
days of freedom, I forced my path through the multitude
that tossed and whirled like the eddies of the ocean. I found
my kinsmen in front, battling desperately against the long
spears of a Roman column, that, solid as iron, and favored
by the higher ground, was pressing down all before it. The
resistance was heroic, but unavailing; and when I burst forward,
I found at my side nothing but faces dark with despair
or covered with wounds. In front was a wall of shields and
helmets, glaring in the light of the conflagration that was
now rapidly spreading on all sides. The air was scorching,
the smoke rolling against us in huge volumes; burning and
loss of blood were consuming the multitude. But what is
in the strength of the soldier or the bravery of discipline to
daunt the desperate energy of men fighting for their country—and,
above all men, of the Israelite, fighting in sight of the
profaned Temple? The native frame, exercised by the habits
of our temperate and agricultural life, was one of surpassing
muscular strength; and man for man thrown naked into the
field, we could have torn the Roman garrison into fragments
for the fowls of the air. But their arms, and the help which
they received from the nature of the ground, were too strong
for the assault of men fighting with no shield but their cloaks
and no arms but a pilgrim’s staff or some weapon caught up
from a dead enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Wounded</div>

<p>Yet on me there came a wild impression that this night
was to make or unmake me; an undefined feeling that in the
shedding of my blood in sight of the Temple there might be
some palliative, some washing away of my crime. I sprang
forward between the combatants and defied the boldest of the
legionaries; the battle paused for an instant, and my name
was shouted in exultation by ten thousand voices. A shower
of lances from the battlements was instantly poured upon me.
I felt myself wounded, but the feeling only roused me to
bolder daring. Tearing off my gory mantle, I lifted it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
point of my javelin, and, with the poniard in my right hand,
devoted the Romans to ruin in the name of the Temple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Death of
a Roman
Tribune</div>

<p>The enemy, in their native superstition, shrank from a
being who looked the messenger of angry Heaven. The naked
figure, the blood streaming from my wounds, the wild and
mystic sound of my words, might have reminded them of the
diviners who had often terrorized their souls in their own
land. I burst into the circle of their spears, waving my
standard and calling on my nation to follow. I smote to the
right and left. The entrance that I had made in the iron bulwark
was instantly filled by the multitude. All discipline
now gave way. The weight of the Roman armor was ruinous
to men grappled hand to hand by the light and sinewy agility
of the Jew. We rushed on, trampling down cuirass and
buckler, till we drove the enemy like sheep before us to the
first gate of the Tower of Antonia. Arrows, lances, stones,
in showers from the battlements, then could not stop the valor
of the people. We rushed on to assault the gate. Sabinus,
the tribune of the legion, rallied the remnant of the fugitives,
and under cover of the battlements made a last attempt to
change the fortunes of the night. Exhausted as I was, bruised
and bleeding, my feet and hands lacerated with the burning
ruins, my tongue cleaving to my mouth with deadly thirst, I
rushed upon him. He had been known to the Jews as a tyrant
and plunderer for the many years of his command. No
trophy of the battle could have been so cheering to them as
his head. But he had the bravery of his country, and it was
now augmented by rage. The despair of being able to clear
himself before imperial jealousy for that night’s disasters
must have made life worthless to him. He bounded on the
drawbridge at my cry. Our meeting was brief; my poniard
broke on his cuirass; his falchion descended with a blow that
would have cloven a headpiece of steel. I sprang aside and
caught it on the shaft of my javelin standard, which it cut
clear in two. I returned the blow with the fragment. The
iron pierced his throat; he flung up his hands, staggered back,
and dropped dead. The roar of Israel rent the heavens!</p>

<p>Scarcely more alive than the trunk at my feet, I fell back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
among the throng. But whatever may be the envy of courts,
no injustice is done in the field. The successful leader is sure
of his reward from the gallant spirits that he has conducted
to victory. I was hailed with shouts—I was lifted on the
shoulders of the multitude; the men of Naphtali proudly
claimed me for their own, and when I clasped the hand of
my brave friend Jubal, whom I found in the foremost rank,
covered with dust and blood, he exclaimed: “Remember
Barak; remember Mount Tabor!”</p>

<p>I looked round in vain for one with whom I had parted
but a few days before, and without whom I scarcely dared
to meet Miriam. Her noble brother was not to be seen.
Had he fallen? Jubal understood my countenance, and
mournfully pointed to the citadel, which rose above us,
frowning down on our impotent rage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eleazar
a Prisoner</div>

<p>“Eleazar is a prisoner?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There can be no hope for him from the hypocritical
clemency of those barbarians of Italy,” was the answer;
“it was with him that the insurrection began. Some new
Roman insolence had commanded that our people should
offer a sacrifice to the image of the emperor—to the polluted,
bloodthirsty tyrant of Rome and mankind. Eleazar shrank
from this act of horror. The tribune, that dog of Rome,
whose tongue you have silenced—so may perish all the enemies
of the Holy City!—commanded that our chieftain should
be scourged at the altar. The cords were round his arms;
the spearmen were at his back; they marched him through
the streets calling on all the Jews to look upon the punishment
that was equally reserved for all. Our indignation
burst forth in groans and prayers. I hastily gathered the
males of our tribe; we snatched up what arms we could, and
were rushing to his rescue when we saw him sweeping the
guard before him. He had broken his bands by a desperate
effort. We fell upon the pursuers. Blood was now drawn,
and we knew the vengeance of the Romans. To break up
and scatter through the country would have been only to give
our throats to their cavalry. Eleazar determined to anticipate
the attack. Messengers were sent round to the leaders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tribes, and the seizure of the Roman fortress was resolved
on. We gathered at nightfall and drove in the outposts.
But the garrison was now roused. We were beaten down by
a storm of darts and javelins, and must have been undone
but for your appearance. In the first onset, Eleazar, while
cheering us to the charge, was struck by a stone from an engine.
I saw him fall among a circle of the enemy, and hastened
to his rescue, but when I reached the spot he was
gone, and my last sight of him was at yonder gate, as he was
borne in, waving his hand—his last farewell to Naphtali.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Moment
of Execution</div>

<p>Deep silence followed his broken accents; he hung his
head on his hand, and the tears glistened through his fingers.
The circle of brave men round us wrapped their heads in their
mantles. I could not contain the bitterness of my soul.
Years had cemented my friendship for the virtuous and generous-hearted
brother of my beloved. He had borne with
my waywardness—he had done all that man could do to
soften my heart, to enlighten my darkness, to awaken me to
a wisdom surpassing rubies. I lifted up my voice and wept.
The brazen blast of a trumpet from the battlements suddenly
raised all our eyes. Troops moved slowly along the walls of
the fortress; they ascended the central tower. Their ranks
opened, and in the midst was seen by the torch-light a man
of Israel. They had brought him to that place of exposure,
in the double cruelty of increasing his torture and ours by
death in the presence of the people. A universal groan burst
from below. He felt it, and meekly pointed with his hand
to that Heaven where no tortures shall disturb the peace of
the departed. The startling sound of the trumpet stung the
ear again—it was the signal for execution. I saw the archer
advance to take aim at him. He drew the shaft. Almost
unconsciously I seized a sling from the hands of one of our
tribe. I whirled it. The archer dropped dead, with the
arrow still on his bow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rescue of Eleazar</div>

<p>To those who had not seen the cause, the effect was almost
a miracle. The air pealed with acclamation; a thousand
slings instantly swept the escort from the battlements; the
walls were left naked—ladders were raised—ropes were slung—axes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
were brandished; the activity of our hunters and
mountaineers availed itself of every crevice and projection of
the walls; they climbed on each other’s shoulders; they leaped
from point to point, where the antelope could have scarcely
found footing; they ran over narrow and fenced walls and
curtains, where, in open daylight and with his senses awake
to the danger, no man could have moved. Torches without
number now showered upon all that was combustible. At
length, the central tower took fire. We fought no longer in
darkness; the flames rolled sheet on sheet above our heads,
throwing light over the whole horizon. We were soon in no
want of help; the tribes poured in at the sight of the conflagration,
and no valor could resist their enthusiasm. Some
cried out that they saw beings mightier than man descending
to fight the battle of the favored nation; some that the day
of Joshua had returned, and that a light of more than earthly
luster was visible in the burning! But the battle was no
longer doubtful. The Romans, reduced in number by the
struggle in the streets, exhausted by the last attack, and
aware, from the destruction of their magazines, that their most
successful resistance must be ended by famine, called out for
terms. I had but one answer—“The life of Eleazar.”<a name="ENanchor_13" id="ENanchor_13"></a><a href="#Endnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
drawbridge fell and he appeared—the next moment he was in
my arms!</p>

<p>The garrison marched out. I restrained the violence of
their conquerors, irritated by the memory of years of insult.
Not a hair of a Roman head was touched. They were led
down to the valley of Kedron, where they were disarmed, and
thence sent without delay under a safeguard to their countrymen
in Idumea. In one night the Holy City was cleared of
every foot of the idolater.</p>

<div class="sidenote">After the
Conflict</div>

<p>While the people were in a state of the wildest triumph,
the joy of their leaders was tempered by many formidable
reflections. The power of the enemy was still unshaken;
the surprise of a single garrison, tho a distinguished evidence
of what might be done by native valor, was trivial on the
scale of a war that must be conducted against the mistress
of the civilized world. The policy of Rome was known; she
never gave up a conquest while it could be retained by the
most lavish and persevering expenditure of her strength. Her
treasury would be stripped of every talent, and Italy left
without a soldier, before she would surrender the most fruitless
spot, an acre of sand or a point of rock in Judea.</p>

<p>I went forth, but not among the leaders nor among the
people; I turned away equally from the council and the triumph.
A deeper feeling urged me to wander round those
courts where my spirit had so often turned in my exile. The
battle had reached even there, and the pollution of blood was
on the consecrated ground. The Roman soldiers, in their advance,
had driven the people to take refuge in the cloisters of
the Temple, and the dead lying thickly among the columns
showed how fierce even that brief and partial struggle had
been. With a torch in my hand, I trod through those heaps
of what once was man to have one parting look at the scene
where I had passed so many blameless hours. I stood before
the porch of my own cloister, almost listening for the sound
of the familiar voices within. The long interval of time was
compressed into an instant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Return Home of Salathiel</div>

<p>I awoke from this reverie with something like scorn at the
idleness of human fancy, and struck open the door. There
was no answer; but the bolts, loosened by time, gave way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and I was again the master of my mansion. It had been uninhabited
since my flight; why, I could not conceive. But as
I passed from room to room I found them all as if they had
been left but the hour before. The embroidery, which Miriam
wrought with a skill distinguished even among the daughters
of the Temple, was still fixed in its frame before the silken
couch; there lay the harp that relieved her hours of graceful
toil; the tissued sandals were waiting for the delicate feet;
the veil, the vermilion mantle that designated her rank, the
tabor, the armlets and necklaces of precious stones, still hung
upon the tripods, untouched by the spoiler. There was but
one evidence of time among them—but that bore its bitter
moral. It was the dust that hung heavy upon the curtains
of precious needlework and chilled the richness of the Tyrian
purple—decay, that teacher without a tongue, the lonely emblem
of what the bustle of mankind must come to at last; the
dull memorial of the proud, the beautiful, the brave! All was
the silence of the tomb! With the torch in my hand, throwing
its red reflection on the walls and remembrances round me,
I sat, like the mummy of an Egyptian king in the sepulcher—in
the midst of the things that I had loved, yet forever divorced
from them by an irresistible law!</p>

<p>I impatiently broke forth into the open air. The stars
were waning; a gray streak of dawn was whitening the summit
of the Mount of Olives. As I passed by Herod’s palace
and lifted my eyes in wonder at the unusual sight of a group
of Jews keeping watch, where but the day before the Roman
governor lorded it and none but the Roman soldier durst
stand, I saw Jubal hurrying out and making signs to me
through the crowd, from the esplanade above. I was instantly
recognized, and all made way for my ascent up those gorgeous
and almost countless steps of porphyry that formed
one of the wonders of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“We have been in alarm about you,” said he hastily; “but
come to the council; we have wasted half the night in perplexing
ourselves. Some are timid, and call out for submission
on any terms; some are rash, and would plunge us
unprepared into the Roman camps. There are obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
many who without regard for the hope of freedom or the holiness
of our cause, look upon the crisis only as a means of personal
aggrandizement. And lastly, we are not without our
traitors, who confound all opinions and who are making
work for Roman gold and iron. Your voice will decide.
Speak at once, and speak our mind; your kinsmen will support
it with their lives.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Vast
Assemblage</div>

<p>The council was held in the amphitheater of the palace.
The heads of families and principal men of the people had
crowded into it until the council, instead of the privacy of
a few chieftains, assumed the look of a great popular assembly.
Tens of thousands had forced themselves into the seats; every
bosom responding to every accent of the orator, a mighty instrument
vibrating through all its strings to the master’s hand.
Accustomed as I was, by the festivals of our nation, to the
sight of great bodies of men swayed by a common impulse, I
stopped in astonishment at the entrance of the colossal circle.
Three-fourths of it was almost totally dark, giving a
shadowy intimation of human beings by the light of a few
scattered torches, or the feeble dawn that rounded the extreme
height with a ring of pale and moon-like rays. But
in the center of the arena a fire blazed, and showed the leaders
of the deliberation seated in the splendid chairs once
assigned to the Roman governors and legionary tribunes.
Eleazar filled the temporary throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Shadow of Rome</div>

<p>The chief man of the land of Ephraim was haranguing the
assembly as I entered. “Go to war with Rome!”<a name="ENanchor_14" id="ENanchor_14"></a><a href="#Endnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> pronounced
he; “you might as well go to war with the ocean,
for her power is as wide; you might as well fight the storm,
for her vengeance is as rapid; you might as well call up the
armies of Judea against the pestilence, for her sword is as
sweeping, as sudden, and as sure. Who but madmen would
go to war without allies? and where are yours to be looked
for? Rome is the mistress of all nations. Would you make
a war of fortresses? Rome has in her possession all your
walled towns. Every tower from Dan to Beersheba has a
Roman banner on its battlements. Would you meet her in
the plain? Where are your horsemen? The Roman cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
would be upon you before you could draw your swords, and
would trample you into the sand. Would you make the campaign
in the mountains? The Roman generals would disdain
to waste a drop of blood upon you; they would only have
to block up the passes and leave famine to do the rest. Harvest
is not come, and if it were, you dare not descend to the
plains to gather it. You are told to rely upon the strength
of the country. Have the fiery sands of the desert, or the
marshes of Germany, or the snows of Scythia, or the stormy
waters of Britain defended <em>them</em>? Does Egypt, within your
sight, give you no example? A land of inexhaustible fertility,
crowded with seven millions of men passionately devoted
to their country, opulent, brave, and sustained by the
countless millions of Africa, with a country defended on both
flanks by the wilderness, in the rear inaccessible to the
Roman, exposing the narrowest and most defensible front of
any nation on earth; yet Egypt, in spite of the Libyan valor
and the Greek genius, is garrisoned at this hour by a single
Roman legion! The Roman bird grasping the thunder in
its talons, and touching with one wing the sunrise and with
the other the sunset, throws its shadow over the world.
Shall we call it to stoop upon us? Must we spread for it the
new banquet of the blood of Israel?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Influence of Onias</div>

<p>How different is the power of speech upon men sitting in
the common, peaceful circumstances of public assemblage,
from its tyranny over minds anxious about their own fates!
All that I had ever seen of public excitement was stone and
ice to the burning interest that hung upon every word of the
orator. The name of Onias was famous in Judea, but I now
saw him for the first time. His had been a life of ambition,
compassed often by desperate means, and wo be to the man
who stood between him and his object. By the dagger and
by subserviency to the Roman procurators he had risen to the
highest rank below the throne. In the distractions of a time
which broke off the regular succession of the sons of Aaron,
Onias had even been High Priest; but Eleazar, heading the
popular indignation, had expelled him from the Temple after
one month of troubled supremacy. I could read his history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in the haughty figure and daring yet wily visage that stood
in bold relief before the central flame. But to the assemblage
his declamation had infinite power; they listened as to
the words of life and death; they had come, not to delight
their ears with showy periods, but to hear what they must
do to escape that inexorable fury which might within a few
days or hours be let loose upon every individual head. All
was alternately the deepest silence and the most tumultuous
agitation. At his strong appeals they writhed their athletic
forms, they gnashed their teeth, they tore their hair; some
crouched to the ground with their faces buried in their hands,
as if shutting out the coming horrors; some started upright,
brandishing their rude weapons and tossing their naked
limbs in gestures of defiance; some sat bending down and
throwing back their long locks, that not a syllable might escape;
others knelt, with their quivering hands clasped and
their pallid countenances turned up in agony of prayer.
Many had been wounded, and their foreheads and limbs,
hastily bound up, were still stained with gore. Turbans and
robes, rent and discolored with dust and burning, were on
every side, and the whole immense multitude bore the look of
men who had but just struggled out of some great calamity
to find themselves on the verge of one still more irremediable.</p>

<p>The orator found that his impression was made, and he
hastened to the close. For this he reserved the sting. “If
it be the desire of those who seek the downfall of Judah that
we should go to war, let it be the first wisdom of those who
seek its safety to disappoint, to defy, and to denounce them.”
The words were followed by a visible movement among the
hearers. “Let an embassy be instantly sent to the proconsul,”
said he, “lamenting the excesses of the night and offering
hostages for peace.” The silence grew breathless; the orator,
wrapped in his robe, and bending his head, like a tiger
crouching, waited for the work of the passions; then suddenly
starting up and fixing his stormy gaze full on Eleazar,
thundered out: “And at the head of those hostages, let the
incendiary who caused this night’s havoc be sent, and sent
in chains!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Turns the Tide</div>

<p>The words were received with fierce applause by the assemblage,
and crowds rushed into the arena to enforce them by
the seizure of Eleazar. I glanced at him; his life hung by a
hair, but not a feature of his noble countenance was disturbed.
I sprang upon the pavement at the foot of the throne; every
moment was precious; the multitude were raging with the
fury of wild beasts. My voice was at length heard; the name
of Salathiel had become powerful, and the tumult partially
subsided. My words were few, but they came from the heart.
I asked them, was it to be thought of that they should deliver
up men of their own nation, of their purest blood, the last
scions of the noblest families of Israel, into the hands of the
idolater! And for what crime? For an act which every true
Israelite would glory to have done: for rescuing the altar of
the living God from pollution. I bade them beware of dipping
their hands in righteous blood, for the gratification of a
revenge that had for twenty years poisoned the breast of a
hoary traitor to his priesthood and his country. There was
a dead silence. I continued:</p>

<p>“We are threatened with the irresistible power of Rome.
Are we to forget that Rome is at this moment torn with internal
miseries, her provinces in revolt, her senate decimated,
her citizens turned into a mass of jailers and prisoners, and,
darkest sign of degradation, that Nero is upon her throne?”
The multitude began to be moved.</p>

<p>“Whom,” said I, “have we conquered this night? A
Roman garrison. Where have we conquered them? In the
midst of their walls and machines. By whom was the conquest
achieved? By the unarmed, undisciplined, unguided
men of Israel. The shepherd and the tiller of the ground,
with but the staff and sling, smote the cuirassed Roman, as
the son of Jesse smote the Philistine!”</p>

<p>The native bravery of the people lived again, and they
shouted, in the language of the Temple: “Glory to the King
of Israel! Glory to the God of David!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Declaration of War</div>

<p>Onias saw the tide turning, and started from his seat to
address the assembly; but he was overpowered with outcries
of anger. Furious at the loss of his fame and his revenge, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
rushed through the arena toward the spot where I stood.
Jubal, ever gallant and watchful, bounded to my side, and
seizing the traitor’s hand in the act of unsheathing a dagger,
wrested the weapon from him, and was ready to plunge it
in his heart at a sign from me. Eleazar’s sonorous voice was
then first heard. “Let no violence be done upon that slave
of his passions. No Jewish blood must stain our holy cause.
Return, Onias, to your tribe, and give the rest of your days to
repentance.” Jubal cast the baffled homicide from his grasp
far into the crowd.</p>

<p>The universal echo now was “war!” “Ruin to the idolater.
War for the Temple.” “War,” I exclaimed, “is wisdom,
honor, security. Let us bow our necks again, and we shall
be rewarded by the ax. The Romans never forgive until
the brave man who resists is either a slave or a corpse; the
work of this night has put us beyond pardon, and our only
hope is in arms, the appeal to that sovereign justice before
which nothing is strong but virtue, truth, and patriotism.
War is inevitable.”</p>

<p>My words, few as they were, rekindled the chilled ardor
of the national heart. They were followed by shouts for
instant battle. “War against the world! liberty to Israel!”
Some voices began a hymn; the habits of the people prepared
them for this powerful mode of expressing their sympathies.
The whole assembly spontaneously stood up and joined in
the hymn. The magnificent invocation of David, “Let God
arise, and let his enemies be scattered,” ascended in solemn
harmonies on the wings of the morning. It was heard over
the awaking city, and answered; the chant of glory spread to
the encampments on the surrounding hills, and in every pause
we heard the responses rolling on the air in rich thunder.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Strength of Judea</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Spirit
of War</div>

<p>The result of our deliberation was that Israel should be
summoned to make a last grand effort; that Jerusalem should
be left with a strong garrison, as the center of the armies; and
that every chieftain should set forth to stir up the energies
of his people.</p>

<p>Eleazar and his kinsmen were instantly upon the road to the
mountains, and all was haste and that mixture of anxiety
and animation which makes all other life tasteless and colorless
to the warrior. With what new vividness did the coming
conflict invest the varied and romantic country through which
we had already journeyed so often! The hill, the ravine, the
superb sweep of forest that we once looked on with but the
vague indulgence of the picturesque eye, now filled us with
the vision of camps and battles. Hunters of the lion, we had
felt something of this interest in tracing the ground where
we were to combat the kingly savage. But what were the
triumphs of the chase to the mighty chances of that struggle
in which a kingdom was to be the field and the Roman glory
the prey!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Reflects</div>

<p>Man is belligerent by nature, and the thought of war summons
up sensations and even faculties within him that in
the common course of life would have been no more discoverable
than the bottom of the sea; the moral earthquake must
come to open the heart for all men to gaze upon. Even
Eleazar’s calm and grave wisdom felt the spirit of the time,
and he reasoned on the probabilities of the struggle with the
lofty ardor of a king preparing to win a new throne. Jubal’s
sanguine temper was unrestrainable; he was the war-horse in
the sight of the banners; his bronzed cheek glowed with hope
and exultation. He saw in every cloud of dust a Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
squadron, and grasped his lance and wheeled his foaming
charger with the eager joy of a soldier longing to assuage his
thirst for battle.</p>

<p>The weight on my melancholy mind was beyond the power
of chance or time to remove, but a new strength was in the
crisis. The world to me was covered with clouds eternal, but
it was now brightened by a wild and keen luster; I saw my
way by the lightning. An irresistible conviction still told
me that the last day of Israel was approaching, and that no
sacrifice of valor or victory could avert the ruin. In the
midst of the loudest exhilaration of the fearless hearts around
me, the picture of the coming ruin would grow upon my eyes.<a name="ENanchor_15" id="ENanchor_15"></a><a href="#Endnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
I saw my generous friends perish one by one; my household
desolate; every name that I ever loved passed away. When I
bent my eyes round the horizon luxuriating in the golden sunshine
of the east, I saw but a huge altar, covered with the
fatal offerings of a slaughtered people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Memory of Past Years</div>

<p>And this was seen, not with the misty uncertainty of a
mind prone to dreams of evil, but with a clearness of foresight,
a distinct and defined reality, that left no room for conjecture.
Yet—and here was the bitterest part of my meditation—what
was all this ruin to me? What were those men
and women and households and lands but as the leaves on
the wind to me! I might strive in the last extremities of
their struggle. I might undergo the agonies of death with
them a thousand times; and I inwardly pledged myself never
to desert their cause while through pain or sorrow I could
cling to it; but this devotion, however protracted, must have
an end. I must see the final hour of them all, and more unhappy,
more destitute, more undone than all, I must be deprived
of the consolation of making my tomb with the righteous
and laying my weary heart in the slumbers of their grave!
Still, I experienced more than the keenest fervor of the impulse
which was now burning around me. With me it was
not kingly care, nor the animal ardency of the soldier. It
was the high stimulation of something like the infusion of
a new principle of existence. I felt as if I had become the
vehicle of a descended spirit. A ceaseless current of thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ran through my brain. Old knowledge that I had utterly
forgotten revived in me with spontaneous freshness. Casual
impressions and long past years arose, with their stamps and
marks as clear as if a hoard of medals had been suddenly
brought to light and thrown before me. I ran over in my
recollection persons and names with painful accuracy. The
conceptions of those for whom I once felt habitual deference
were now seen by me in their nakedness. All that was habitual
was passed away; I saw intuitively the vanity and giddiness,
the inconsequential reasoning, the bewildering prejudice,
that made up what in other days I had called the wisdom of
the wise.</p>

<p>As I threw out in the most unpremeditated language the
ideas thus glowing and struggling for escape, I found that the
impression of some extraordinary excitement in me was universal.
Accustomed to be heard with the attention due to my
rank, I now saw the eyes of my fellow travelers turned on
me with an evident and deferential surprise. When I talked
of the hopes of the country, of the resources of the enemy, of
the kingdoms that would be ready to make common cause with
us against the galling tyranny of Nero, of the glory of fighting
for our altars, and of the imperishable honors of those
whose blood earned peace for their children, they listened as
to something more than man. “Was I the prophet delegated
at last to lead Judea to her glory?”</p>

<p>At those discourses, bursting from my lips with unconscious
fire, the old men would vow the remnant of their days to the
field; the young would sweep over the country performing the
evolutions of the Roman cavalry, then return brandishing their
weapons and demanding to be let loose on the first cohort
that crossed the horizon. With me every pulse now was war.
The interest which this new direction of our minds gave to all
things grew more intense. I spurred to the barren heath;
it had now no deformity, for upon it I saw the spot from which
battle might be offered to an army advancing through the
valley below. The marsh that spread its yellow stagnation
over the plain might be worth a province for the protection
of my camp. The thicket, the broken bank of the torrent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the bluff promontory, the rock, the sand, every repellent
feature of the landscape was invested with the value of a
thing of life and death, a portion of the great stake in the
game that was so soon to be played for restoration or ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Land of
Judea</div>

<p>Those are the delights of soldiership, the indescribable and
brilliant colorings which the sense of danger, the desire for
fame, and the hope of triumph throw over life and nature.
Yet, if war was ever to be forgiven for its cause, to be justified
by the high remembrances and desperate injuries of a people,
or to be encouraged by the physical strength of a country, it
was this, the final war of Israel. In all my wanderings I
have seen no kingdom, for defense, equal to Judea.<a name="ENanchor_16" id="ENanchor_16"></a><a href="#Endnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It had
in the highest degree the three grand essentials, compactness
of territory, density of population, and strength of frontier.
If I were at this hour to be sent forth to select from the
earth a kingdom, I should say, even extinguishing the recollections
of my being and the love which I bear to the very
weeds of my country—for beauty, for climate, for natural
wealth, and for invincible security, give me Judea!</p>

<p>The Land of Promise had been chosen by the Supreme
Wisdom for the inheritance of a people destined to be unconquerable
while they continued pure. It was surrounded on
all sides but one by mountains and deserts, and that one was
defended by the sea, which at the same time opened to it the
intercourse with the richest countries of the west. On the
north, opposed to the vast population of Asia Minor, it was
protected by the double range of the Libanus and Antilibanus,
a region of forests and defiles at all seasons almost impassable
to chariots and cavalry, and during winter barred up with
torrents and snows. The whole frontier to the east and south
was a wall of mountain rising from a desert—a durable barrier
over which no enemy, exhausted by the privations of an
Asiatic march, could force their way against a brave army
waiting fresh within its own confines. But even if the Syrian
wastes of sand and the fiery soil of Arabia left the invaders
strength to master the mountain defenses, the whole interior
was full of the finest positions for defense that ever caught
the soldier’s eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Preparations
for War</div>

<p>All the mountains sent branches through the champaign.
As we spurred up the sides of Carmel, we saw an horizon
covered with cloud-like hills. Every city was built on an
eminence and capable of being instantly converted into a fortress.
But while an army kept the field, the larger operations
of strategy would have found matchless support in the
course of the Jordan, the second defense of Judea; a line
passing through the whole central country from north to south,
with the lake of Tiberias and the lake Asphaltites at either
extreme, at once defending and supplying the movements in
front, flank, and rear.</p>

<p>The territory thus defensible had an additional and superior
strength in the character and habits of its population. In a
space of two hundred miles long by a hundred broad, its inhabitants
once amounted to nearly four millions, tillers of the
soil, bold tribes, invigorated by their life of industry and
connected with one another by the most intimate and frequent
intercourse, under the divine command. By the law of Moses—may
he rest in glory!—every man from twenty to sixty was
liable to be called on for the general defense; and the customary
armament of the tribes was appointed at six hundred
thousand men!</p>

<p>The munitions of war were in abundance. All the varieties
of troops known in the ancient armies were to be found in
Judea, in the highest discipline; from the spearsman to the
archer and the slinger, from the heavy-armed soldier of the
fortress to the ranger of the desert and the mountain. Cavalry
was prohibited, for the great purpose of the Jewish armament
was defense. The spirit of the Jewish code was peace.
By the prohibition of cavalry, no conquests could be made on
the bordering kingdoms of interminable plains. The command
that the males of the tribes should go up thrice in the
year to the great festivals of Jerusalem was equally opposed
to the encroachments on the neighboring states. It was not
until Israel had abandoned the purity of the original covenant
with Heaven that the evils of ambition or tyranny were felt
within her borders.</p>

<p>Israel’s whole policy was under a divine sanction, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
whole preservation was distinguished by the perpetual agency
of miracle, for the obvious purpose of compelling the people
to know the God of their fathers. But the physical strength
of such a people in such a territory was incalculable. Severity
of climate will not ultimately repel an invader, for that
severity scatters and exhausts the native population. Difficulties
of country have always been overcome by a daring invader
in the attack of a feeble or negligent people. To what
nation were their snows, their marshes, or their sands a barrier
against the great armies of the ancient or the modern
world? The Alps and the Pyrenees have been passed as
often as they have been attempted. But no empire can conquer
a nation of millions of men determined to resist; no
army that could be thrown across the frontier would find the
means of penetrating through a compact population, of which
every man was a soldier and every soldier was fighting for
his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Effect of
Determined
Resistance</div>

<p>The Jew was, by his law, a free proprietor of the soil.<a name="ENanchor_17" id="ENanchor_17"></a><a href="#Endnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
He was no serf, no broken vassal. He inherited his portion
of the land by an irrevocable title. Debt, misfortune, or time
could not extinguish his right. Capable of being alienated from
him for a few years, the land was returned to him at the Jubilee.
He was then once more a possessor, the master of a competence,
and restored to his rank amongst his fellow men.
This bond, the most benevolent and the strongest that ever
bound man to a country, was the bond of the Covenant. If
Israel had held the institutions of her lawgiver inviolate, she
would have seen the Assyrian, the Egyptian, and the Roman,
with all their multitudes, only food for the vulture. But we
were a rebellious people; we sullied the purity of the Mosaic
ordinances; we abandoned the sublime ceremonial of divine
worship for the profligate rites of paganism; we rejected the
Lord of the theocracy for the pomps of an earthly king.
Then the mighty protection that had been to us as an eagle’s
wings and as a wall of fire was withdrawn. Our first punishment
was by our own hand; the union of Israel was a band of
flax in the flame. The tribes revolted. The time was come
for the hostile idolater to do his work. We were overwhelmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
by enemies in alliance with our own blood. The banners of
Jacob were seen waving beside the banners of Ashtaroth and
Apis. An opening was made into the bosom of the land for
all invasion; the barriers of the mountain and the desert were
in vain; the proverbial bravery of the Jew only rendered his
chain more severe; and the policy that of old united the
highest wisdom with the most benevolent mercy became at
once the scoff and problem of the pagan world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Land of
Invasion</div>

<p>But opulence, salubrity, and luxuriance of production belonged
to the site of the land of Israel. It lay central between
the richest regions of the world. It was the natural
road of the traffic of India with the west; that traffic which
raised Tyre and Sidon from rocks and shallows on a fragment
of the shore of Judea into magnificent cities, and which
was yet to raise into political power and unrivaled wealth
the rocks and shallows of the remotest shore of the Mediterranean.
Our mountain ranges tempered the hot winds from
the wilderness. The sea cooled the summer heats with the
living breeze, and tempered the chill of winter. Our fields
teemed with perpetual fruits and flowers.</p>

<p>The extent of the land, tho narrow, when contrasted
with the surrounding kingdoms, was yet not to be measured
by its lineal boundaries;<a name="ENanchor_18" id="ENanchor_18"></a><a href="#Endnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a country intersected everywhere
by chains of hills capable of cultivation to the summit, alike
multiplies its surface and varies its climate. We had at
the foot of the hill the products of the torrid zone; on
its side those of the temperate; on its summit the robust
vegetation of the north. The ascending circles of the orange-grove,
the vineyard, and the forest covered it with perpetual
beauty.</p>

<p>This scene of matchless productiveness is fair and fertile no
more. For ages before my eyes opened on the land of my
fathers the national misfortunes had impaired its original
loveliness. The schism of the tribes, the ravages of successive
invaders, and still more, the continued presence of the idolater
and the alien in the heart of the land, turned large portions of
it into desert. The final fall almost destroyed the traces of
its fruitfulness. What can be demanded from the soil lorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
over by the tyranny of the Moslem, stripped of its population,
and given up to the mendicant, the monk, and the robber?</p>

<p>But more than human evil smote my unhappy country.
The curse pronounced by our great prophet three thousand
years ago has been deeply fulfilled. “The stranger that shall
come from a far land shall say, when he beholdeth the plagues
of the land, and the sickness that the Lord hath laid upon it,
the land of brimstone and salt and burning, even all nations
shall say, Wherefore hath the Lord done this unto this
land? What meaneth the heat of this great anger? Then
men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of
the Lord God of their fathers!”</p>

<p>The soil has been blasted. Sterility has struck into its
heart. Whole provinces are covered with sands and ashes.
It has the look of an exhausted volcano.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Might
Have Been</div>

<p>Yet, what might have been the progress of this people!
The glory of Israel is no fine vision of the fancy. The same
prophetic word which has given terrible demonstration of its
reality in our ruin declares the hope once held forth to our
obedience. Judea was to have borne the first rank among nations;
to have been an object of universal honor; to have
been unconquerable; to have enjoyed unwearied fertility; to
have been protected from the casualties of the elements; to
have been free from disease, the life of its people continuing
to the farthest limit of our nature. A blessing was to be
upon the labors, the possessions, and the persons of the tribes;
all Israel a holy nation in the highest sense of the word—a
sovereign race to which the world should pay a willing and
happy homage.</p>

<p>What must have been the operation of this illustrious instance
of the preservative power of Heaven on the darkened
empires; of the scriptural lights perpetually beaming from
Judea; of the living, palpable happiness and obedience to the
Supreme; of the perpetual security of the land in the divine
protection; of the internal peace, health, plenteousness, and
freedom? Man is weak and passionate, but no blindness could
have hid from his contemplations this proof of the human
value of virtue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Influence
of Judea</div>

<p>We must add to this the direct influence of a governing
people, placed in its rank for the express purpose of a guide
to nations. Combining the knowledge and devotedness of a
priesthood with the actual power and dignity of kings; by
its own constitution as safe from all encroachments as prohibited
from all aggression; informed by the immediate wisdom
and sustained by the visible arm of Omnipotence, Judea
might have changed the earth into a paradise, and raised universal
man to the highest happiness, knowledge, and grandeur
of human nature!</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Prince of Naphtali Confronts Desolation</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Choice of
a Leader</div>

<p>War was now inevitable. Attempts had been made by our
rulers to propitiate the Roman emperor, but their answer was
the march of a legion to Jerusalem. The seizure of some of
the people who had made themselves conspicuous in the late
capture of the citadel followed, and an order was despatched
to the governor of Galilee for the execution of Eleazar. His
tribe instantly assembled and all voices were for resistance.
My noble kinsman, still pacific, offered himself as the victim.
But this generous sacrifice we all denounced, and called for
war. The appointment of a leader was next debated in a
hurried assemblage, to which every head of a village came in
arms. No man could contest the command with Eleazar.
But he declined it from a sense of his inexperience in war in
a few simple words.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly bursting into ardor, he exclaimed: “Our
war is holy! It is not to be hazarded on the claims of hereditary
rank, personal freedom, or even on national favoritism.
The only claims which the nation must acknowledge in its
extremity are the rights of tried talent, experienced intrepidity,
and unquestionable service. Such a leader stands among
us at this moment.” Every eye was turned upon <em>me</em>. “Yes,”
exclaimed my noble kinsman, “you have already made your
choice. Genius, valor, and success have combined to mark
one man for the leader of Israel. He is worthy of the diadem.”
Then turning to me and lifting his hand, as if he was
letting fall the diadem upon my head, “Go forth,” cried he
in a tone of almost prophetic grandeur, “Go forth, prince of
Naphtali, leader of Israel, to break the chains of Judah and
conquer in the cause of man and Heaven!” The words were
received with acclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>I vainly protested against the general voice, that I was a
priest of the Temple of the house of Aaron, of the tribe of
Levi, and bound to Naphtali only by ties of kindred and
gratitude. I was answered by a multitude of voices that my
summons was actually in the service of the Temple; that war
extinguished all office but that of defending the country; that
I had long retired from the duties of the priesthood; that
Moses was at once the priest and the leader; that Samuel was
at once the prophet and the sovereign of Israel; above all,
that I had shown myself, by daring and success, almost superior
to man, the Heaven-elected leader of Israel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Becomes
a Leader</div>

<p>I acknowledged that my heart was with the answerers, and
I at length gave way to what even I believed to be the will
of more than man. A thousand falchions, wielded by as
sinewy hands as ever drew sword, were instantly moved round
my head. I was placed on a shield, and in this ancient fashion
of our countrymen I was inaugurated prince of Naphtali.
This was one of the blinding flashes that broke in from time
to time on my gloomy career. When the assemblage dispersed
and I returned toward my mountain home, I was still
in the excitement of the scene. I even began to imagine that
my terrible sentence was about to be lightened, perhaps to
pass away; my station in life was now fixed; services of the
highest rank in the noblest cause were before me, and I felt
myself exclaiming, even to the solitude, “I am prince of
Naphtali!”<a name="ENanchor_19" id="ENanchor_19"></a><a href="#Endnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> My exultation was soon to have a fall.</p>

<p>It was the evening of one of the freshest days of the loveliest
season of earth, the spring of Palestine. All nature was
clothed with its robe of genial beauty; the olives on the higher
grounds had put forth their first green, and with every slight
gust that swept across them heaved like sheets of emerald;
the birds sang in a thousand notes from every bush; the sheep
and camels lay in the meadows visibly enjoying the sweet air;
the shepherds sat gathered together on the side of some gentle
eminence, talking, or listening to the songs of the maidens
who came in long lines to the fountains below. The heavens
gave prospect of a glorious day in the colors shown only to
the Oriental eyes; hues so brilliant that many a traveler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
stops on the verge of the valleys arrested, in his haste
homeward, by the pomp above. All was the loveliness and
joy of pastoral life, in the only country where I ever found it
realized. The mind is to be medicined by natural loveliness,
and mine was doubly cheered. To return to our home is at
all times a delight; but the new conjuncture, the high hopes
of the future, and the consciousness that a career of the most
distinguished honors might be opening before my steps, made
this return more vivid than all the past; and when we reached
the foot of the long ascent from which my dwelling was visible
I felt an impatience beyond restraint, and spurred up the
hill with my tidings. How fine the ear becomes when quickened
by the heart! As the mountain road, now more difficult
by the darkness of the wild pines and cedars that crowned the
summit, compelled me to slacken my pace, I thought that I
could distinguish the household voices, the barking of my
hounds, and the laugh of the retainers and peasantry that
during the summer crowded my doors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Daughters</div>

<p>I pictured the dearer group that had so often welcomed
me. The early and cruel loss of my son had not been repaired.
I was not destined to be the father of a race; but two
daughters were given to me, and in the absence of all ambition,
they were more than a recompense. Salome, the elder,
was now approaching womanhood; she had the dark eyes
and animated beauty of her mother; the foot of the antelope
was not lighter; and her wreathed smile, her laugh of innocence,
and her buoyancy of soul forbade sorrow in her sight.
How changed I afterward saw that face of living joy! What
floods of sorrow bathed those cheeks, that once shamed the
Persian rose!</p>

<p>The younger was scarcely more than a child; her mind and
her form were yet equally in the bud, but she had an eye of
the deepest azure, a living star; and even in her playfulness
there was an elevation, a lofty and fervent spirit, that made
me often forget her years. She was mistress of music almost
by nature, and the cadences and rich modulations that poured
from her harp, under fingers slight and feeble, as if the stalks
of flowers had been flung across the strings, were like secrets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of harmony treasured for her touch alone. Our prophets, the
true masters of the sublime, were her rapturous study. Their
truths might yet be veiled, but their genius blazed broad upon
her sensitive soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sound in
the Thicket</div>

<p>I pictured my children hastening through the portal, hand
in hand with their noble mother, still in the prime of matronly
beauty, to give me welcome. The light thickened, and the
intricacy of the forest impeded me. At length, wearied by
the delay, I sprang from my horse, left him to make his way
as best he could, and pushed forward through a thicket which
crept round the skirts of the forest. As I struggled onward,
listening with sharpened anxiety for every sound of home, I
heard a noise like that of a wild beast rustling close at my
side. The thicket was now dark. My eyes were useless. I
drew my simitar, and plunged it straight before me. The blow
was instantly followed by a shriek. Friend or enemy, silence
was now impossible, and I demanded who was nigh. I was
answered but by groans; my next step was on a human body.
Shocked and startled, I lifted it in my arms and bore the
dying man to an open space where the moonlight glimmered.
To my unspeakable horror, he was one of my most favored
attendants, whom I had left in the principal charge of my
household; I had slain him. I tore up my mantle to stanch
his wound, but he fiercely repelled my hand. In an undefined
dread of some evil to my family, I commanded him to
speak, if but one word, and tell me that all was safe. He
buried his face in his mantle.</p>

<p>In the whirlwind of my thoughts I flung him from me,
that I might go forward and know the good or evil; but he
clung round my feet, and exerted his last breath to implore
me not to leave him to die alone.</p>

<p>“You have killed me,” said he, in broken accents; “but it
was only the hand of the Avenger. I was corrupted by gold.
You have terrible enemies among the leaders of Jerusalem; a
desperate deed has been done.”</p>

<p>My suspense amounted to agony; I made another effort to
cast off the trammels of the assassin, but he still implored.</p>

<p>“Evil things were whispered against you. I was told that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
you had been convicted of a horrible crime.” The sound shot
through my senses; he must have felt the trembling of my
frame, for he for the first time looked upon my face.</p>

<p>“My sight is gone,” groaned he, and fell back. I dared
not meet the glance even of his clouding eyes. “They said
that you were condemned to an unspeakable punishment and
that the man who swept the world of you and yours did God
service. In my hour of sin the tempter met me, and this day
from sunrise have I lurked on your road to strike my benefactor
and my lord. In the dark I lost my way in the thicket;
but vengeance found me.”</p>

<p>“My wife, my children, are they safe?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>He quivered, relaxed his hold, and uttering “Forgive!”
two or three times, with nervous agony, expired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Finds Ruin</div>

<p>A single bound from this spot of death placed me on a point
of rock from which I had often gazed on my little world in
the valley. The moon was now bright and the view unobstructed.
I looked down. Were my eyes dim? There was
no habitation beneath me; the grove, the garden, were there,
sleeping in the moonlight; but all that had the semblance of
life was gone! I rushed down and found myself among ruins
and ashes still hot. I called aloud—in terror and distraction,
I yelled to the night, but no voice answered me. My foot
struck upon something in the grass; it was a sword dyed with
recent blood. There had been burning, plunder, slaughter
here in this treasure-house of my heart; desolation had been
busy in the center of what was to me life—more than life. I
raved; I flew through the fields; I rushed back, to convince
myself that I was not in some frightful dream. What I endured
that night I never endured again; that conflict of fear,
astonishment, love, and misery could be contained but once
even in my bosom; in all others it must have been death. In
the moment of reviving hope I had been smitten. While my
spirit was ascending on the wings of justified ambition and
sacred love of country, I had been dashed down to earth, a
desolate and a desperate man.</p>

<p>What I did thenceforth, or how I passed through that night,
I know not; but I was found in the morning with my robe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
fantastically thrown over me like a royal mantle, and a fragment
of half-burned wood for a scepter in my hand, performing
the part of a monarch, giving orders for the rebuilding
of my palace, and marshaling the movements of an army of
shrubs and weeds. I was led away with the lofty reluctance
of a captive sovereign, to the household of Eleazar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Fruitless
Search</div>

<p>The wrath and grief of my kinsmen were without bounds.
Every defile of the mountains was searched—every straggler
seized; messengers were despatched across the frontier with
offers of ransom to the chiefs of the desert, in case my family
should have escaped the sword. Threats of severe retaliation
were used by the Roman governor of the province; all was in
vain. The only intelligence was from a shepherd, who, two
nights before, had seen a troop which he supposed to be
Arabs, ride swiftly by the gates of Kuriathim, our nearest
city; but this intelligence only added to the misfortune.
The habits of those robbers were proverbially savage; they
lived by the torch and the sword; they slaughtered the men
without mercy; the females they generally sold into endless
captivity. To leave no trace of their route, they slaughtered
the captives whom they could not carry through their hurried
marches. To leave no trace of what they had done, they
burned the place of massacre. But this ruin was from other
and more malignant hands!</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Wandering of a Mind Diseased</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Tyranny
of
Imagination</div>

<p>What I might have suffered in the agony of a bereaved
husband and father was spared me. My visitation was of
another kind; dreadful, yet perhaps not so preeminently
wretched, nor so deeply striking at the roots of life. My brain
had received an overwhelming blow.<a name="ENanchor_20" id="ENanchor_20"></a><a href="#Endnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Imagination was to
be my tyrant; and every occurrence of life, every aspect of
humanity, every variety of nature, day and night, sunshine
and storm, made a portion of its fearful empire. What is insanity
but a more vivid and terrible dream? It has the
dream-like tumult of events, the rapidity of transit, the quick
invention, the utter disregard of place and time. The difference
lies in its intensity. The madman is awake; and the
open eye administers a horrid reality to the fantastic vision.
The vigor of the senses gives a living and resistless strength
to the vagueness of the fancy; it compels together the fleeting
mists of the mind, and embodies them into shapes of deadly
power.</p>

<p>I was mad! but all my madness was not painful. Books,
my old delight, still lulled my mind. I turned the pages of
some volume; then fancy waved her wand, and built upon
its contents a world of adventure. Every language appeared
to open treasures to me. I roved through all lands; I saw
all those eminent in rank or genius; I drank of the fountains
of poetry; I addressed listening senates, and heard the air
echo with applause. Wit, beauty, talent, laid their inestimable
tributes at my feet. I was exalted to the highest triumphs
of mind; and then came my fate. In the midst of my
glory came a cloud, and I was miserable. This bitter sense
of defeat was a characteristic of my visions. Be the cup ever
so sweet, it had a poison drop at bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel in
the Past</div>

<p>The history of my country was most frequent on my mind.
I imagined myself the great King of Babylon. From the
superb architecture of those palaces, in which Nebuchadnezzar
forgot that he was but a man, I issued my mandates to a hundred
monarchs. I saw the satraps of the East bow their
jeweled necks before my throne. I rode at the head of countless
armies, lord of Asia, and prospective conqueror of all
the realms that saw the sun. In the swellings of my haughty
soul I exclaimed, like him, “Is not this the great Babylon
that I have built?” and like him, in the very uttering of the
words I was cast out, humbled to the grass of the field, hideous,
brutal, and wretched.…</p>

<p>I was Belshazzar. I sat in the halls of glory. I heard
the harps of minstrels, the voices of singing men and women.
The banquet was before me; I was surrounded by the trophies
of irresistible conquest. Beauty, flattery, splendor, the
delight of the senses, the keener feast of vanity, the rich
anticipation of triumph measureless and endless, made me
all but a god. I put the profaned cup of the Temple to
my lips. Thunder pealed; the serene sky, the only canopy
worthy of my banquet and my throne, was sheeted over with
lightning. I swallowed the wine—it was poison and fire in
my veins. The gigantic hand came forth and wrote upon the
wall.…</p>

<p>The moon, that ancient mistress of the diseased mind,
strongly exerted her spells on mine. I loved her light, but
it was only when it mingled softly with the shadows of the
forest and the landscape. I welcomed her return from darkness
as the coming of some guardian genius to shed at once
beauty and healing on its path. Darkness was to me a source
of terror; daylight overwhelmed me, but the gentle splendor
of the crescent had a dewy and refreshing influence on my
faculties. I exposed my feverish forehead to her beams, as
if to bathe it in celestial balm. I felt in her gradual increase,
an increase of power to soothe and console. This indulgence
grew into a kind of visionary passion. I saw in the crescent,
as it sailed up the ether, a galley crowded with forms of surpassing
loveliness, faces that bent down and smiled upon me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and hands that showered treasures, to be collected by mine
alone. But excess even of her light always disturbed me.
From the full splendor of the moon there was no escape; the
rays smote upon me with merciless infliction; I fled to the
woods as a hunted deer; a thousand shafts of light penetrated
the shade. I hid myself in the depths of my chamber;
flames of lambent silver, curling and darting in forms innumerable,
shot round my couch. Upon the inequalities of the
ground, or the waves of the fountain and the river, serpents
of the most inimitable luster, yet of the most deadly poison,
coiled and sprang after me with a rapidity that mocked human
feet. If I dared to glance upward, I beheld a menacing visage
distending to an immeasurable magnitude, and ready to
pour down wrath; or an orb with its mountains and oceans
swinging loose through the heaven and rolling down upon
my solitary brow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hours of
Terror</div>

<p>But those were my hours of comparative happiness. I had
visions of unspeakable terror; flights through regions of space,
that left earth and the sun incalculable millions of miles behind;
flights ceaseless, hopeless—still hurrying onward with
more than winged speed through infinite worlds, and still enduring;
the heart sickening and withering with a consciousness
of being swept beyond the bounds of living things, and
of being doomed to this forever.</p>

<p>Those trials changed into every shape of desperation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Increase of Gloom</div>

<p>… I was driven out to sea in a bark that let in every
wave. I struggled to reach the land; I tore my sinews with toil;
I saw the trees, the shore, the hills, sink in slow, yet sure succession;
I felt in the hands of an invisible power, bent on my
undoing. The storm subsided, the sun shone, the ocean was
without a surge. Still I struggled; with the strength of despair
I toiled to regain the land—to retard the viewless force
that was perpetually urging me further from existence. I began
to suffer thirst and hunger. They grew to pain, to torture,
to madness. I felt as if molten lead were poured down my
throat. I put my arm to my mouth, and shuddering, quenched
my thirst in my own veins. It returned instantly with a more
fiery sting. There was nothing in the elements to give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
hope—to draw off thought from my own fate—to deaden the
venomed sensibilities that quivered through every fiber. The
wind slept; the sky was cloudless; the sea smooth as glass;
not a distant sail, not a wandering bird, not a springing fish,
not even a floating weed, broke the terrible monotony. The
sun did not pass down the horizon. All above me was unvaried,
motionless sky; all around me, unvaried, motionless
ocean. I alone moved—still urged further from the chance
of life; still undergoing new accessions of agony that made
the past trivial. I tasted the water beside me; it added fire
to fire. I convulsively darted out my withered hands, as if
they could have drawn down the rain or grasped the dew. I
withered piecemeal, yet with a continuing consciousness in
every fragment of my frame!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes of the Imagination</div>

<p>My visitation changed.… I wandered at midnight
through a country of mountains. Worn out with fatigue, I lay
down upon a rock. I found it heave under me. I heard a
thunder-peal. A sudden blaze kindled the sky. Bewildered
and stunned, I started to my feet. The mountains were on
flame; a hundred mouths poured down torrents of liquid fire;
they came shooting in sulfurous cataracts down the chasms.
The forests burned before them like a garment—the rocks
melted—the rivers flew up in sheets of vapor—the valleys
were basins of glowing ore—the clouds of smoke and ashes
gathered over my head in a solid vault of gloom, sullenly
illuminated by the conflagration below—the land was a cavern
of fire. In terror inconceivable, I ran, I bounded, I plunged
down declivities, I swam rivers; still the fiery torrents hunted
my steps as if they had been commissioned against me alone.
I felt them gathering speed on me; when I bounded, the spot
from which I sprang was on flame before I alighted on the
ground. I climbed a promontory with an effort that exhausted
my last nerve. The fatal lava swept round its foot and in
another instant must encircle me. I ran along the edge of a
precipice that made the brain turn; the fire chased me from
pinnacle to pinnacle. I clung to the weeds and trunks of
trees on its sides, and, in fear of being dashed to pieces,
tremblingly let myself down the wall of perpendicular rock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Breathless and dying at the bottom of the descent, I glanced
upward; the flame of the thicket on the brow showed me my
pursuer. I saw the rapid swelling of the molten tide. In
another moment it plunged through the air in a white column;
the valley was instantly an expanse of conflagration—every
spot was inundated with the blaze. I flew, with scorching
feet, with every sinew of my frame parched and dried of its
substance—with my eyes blinded and my lungs burned up
by the suffocating fumes that rushed before, around, and
above me.</p>

<p>At length my limit was reached. The land afforded no
further room for flight. I stood on the verge of the ocean.
Death was inevitable. I had but the choice. Before me
spread the world of waters, sad, dim, fathomless, interminable;
behind me, the world of flame. By a last desperate
effort, I plunged into the ocean. The indefatigable lava rolled
on, mass on mass, like armies rushing to the assault. The
billows shrank before the fiery shock, sheets of vapor rolled
up; still the eruption rolled on, and the returning billows
fought against it. The conflict shook the land; the mountain
shore crumbled down; the sands melted and burned vitreous;
the atmosphere discharged scalding torrents; the winds,
shaken from their balance, raged with the violence of more
than tempest. Thunder roared in peals that shook the earth,
the ocean, and the heavens. In the midst of all I lived, tossed
like a grain of sand in the whirlwind.</p>

<p>Strange and harassing as those trials of my mind were,
they had yet contained some appeals to individual energy,
some excitement of personal powers, that produced a kind,
of cheering self-applause. I was Prometheus on his rock
chained and remediless, yet still resisting and unconquered.
But the real misery was when I was passive.</p>

<p>… I strayed through an Egyptian city. Buildings numberless,
of the most regal designs, rose round me; the walls
were covered with sculptures of extraordinary richness; noble
statues lined the public ways; wealth in the wildest profusion
was visible wherever the foot trod. Endless ranges of porphyry
and alabaster columns glittered in the noonday sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Superb ascents of marble steps mounted before me, to heights
that strained the eye. Arch over arch studded with the luster
of precious stones climbed until they lay like rainbows upon
the sky. Colossal towers circling with successive colonnades
of dazzling brightness, ascended—airy citadels, looking down
upon earth, and colored with the infinite dyes and lusters of the
clouds. But all was silence in this scene of pomp. There
was no tread of human being heard within the circuit of a city,
fit for more than man. The utter extinction of all that gives
the idea of life was startling; there was not the note of a passing
bird, nor the chirp of a grasshopper. I instinctively
shrank from the sight of things lovely in themselves, yet
which froze my mind by their image of the tomb. But to
escape was impossible; there was an impression of powerlessness
upon me, for whose melancholy I can find no words.
My feet were chainless, but never fetter clung with such a retarding
weight as that invisible bond by which I was fixed to
the spot. Ages on ages seemed to have heavily sunk away,
and still I stood, bound by the same manacle, standing on
the same spot, looking on the same objects. To this I would
have preferred the fiercest extremes of suffering. Of all
passions that dwell within the heart of man, the passion
for change is the most incapable of being extinguished or
eluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the
Twilight</div>

<p>But a change at length came. The sun sank. Twilight
fell, shade on shade, on tower and column until total darkness
shrouded the scene of glory. Yet, as if a new faculty of sight
were given to me, the thickest darkness did not blunt the eye.
I still saw all things—the minutest figures of the architecture,
the finest carving of the airy castles, whose height was, even
in the sunshine, almost too remote for vision. Suddenly
there echoed the murmur of many voices, the tramping of
many feet; the colossal gates opened and a procession of
forms innumerable entered; they were of every period of life,
of every pursuit, of every rank, of every country. All the
various emblems of station, all the weapons and implements
of mankind, all costumes, rich and strange, civilized and savage;
all the attributes and adjuncts of the occupations of society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
were in that mighty train. The monarch, sceptered and
crowned passed on his throne; the soldier reining in his
charger; the philosopher gazing on his volume; the priest
bearing the instruments of sacrifice. It was the triumph of a
power ruling all mankind; but ruling them when their world
has passed away—<span class="smcap">Death</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Spectral
Procession</div>

<p>While I gazed in breathless awe, I found myself involved
in the procession. Resistance was in vain. I was conscious
that I might as well have struggled against the tides of the
ocean, or thought to stop the revolution of the globe. We
advanced through the place of darkness by millions of millions,
yet without crowding the majestic avenue or reaching
its close. I rapidly recognized a multitude of faces which I
had known from the models and memorials of the past ages.
But the power that marshaled them had no regard for time.
The pale, fixed Asiatic countenance of Ninus moved beside
the glowing cheek and flashing eye of Alexander. The patriarch
followed the Cæsar. The thousand years were as one
day, the one day as a thousand years.</p>

<p>Again the whole stately train suddenly melted before the
eye, and I was alone, in tenfold darkness—entombed. I lay
in the sepulcher, but with the full vividness of life, and with
a perfect knowledge that there it was my doom to lie forever.
A miraculous foresight gave me the fearful privilege of looking,
into the most remote futurity. Ages on ages unfolded
themselves, with all their wonders, to tantalize me. I saw
worlds awake from chaos and return to it in flood and flame.
I saw systems swept away like the sand. The universe withered
with years, and rolled up like the parchment scroll. I
saw new regions of space, glowing with a new creation; the
angelic hierarchies rising through new energies, new triumphs,
new orders of existence; developments of power and magnificence,
of sublime mercy and essential glory, too high for the
conception of mortal faculties. Yet I was still to be entombed!
No ray of light, no sound, no trace of external being, no sympathy
of flesh or spirit, of earth or heaven was to reach me.
The four narrow walls, the winding-sheet, the worm, were my
world! I seemed to lie thus, for periods beyond all counting;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
powerless to move a limb; the sleepless, conscious, vivid
victim of misery unspeakable—the bondsman of the sepulcher!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Vivid
Imagination</div>

<p>In those wanderings, I experienced not even the slightest
recollection of the cause which had so sternly shaken my
brain; wife, children, country, were a blank. Imagination,
that strangest and most imperious of our faculties, whose
soarings from earth to heaven may be among the indications
of power beyond the grave, disdains to linger on the realities
of our being. It delights in the commanding, the bold, the
superb. In my instance it had the wildness of disease; but
who has ever felt its workings, even in the dream of health,
without wonder at its passion for the richer and more highly
relieved remembrances; its singular skill in throwing together
the loftier portions of life and nature, to the total disregard
of the level; its subtlety in the seizure of the circumstances of
pain, its fabrication of adventure, at once of the most regular
consecutiveness, and the wildest originality; and all characterized
by the same spontaneous swiftness of change and
illimitable command over space and time, a power of instant
flight from continent to continent, and from world to world—the
transit that would actually fill up years and ages the
work of a moment!—the actual moment expanding into years
and ages!</p>

<p>What are those but the infant attributes of the disembodied
spirit!—the imperfect developments of a state of being to
which time and space are as nothing—when man, shaking off
the covering of the grave, shall be clothed with the might of
angels!—the splendid denizen of Infinitude and Eternity!</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Fury of a Tempest</i></span></h3>

<p>At length the past returned to my mind. Dim recollections,
shadows that alternately advanced and eluded me,
sketches of forms and events, like pictures unfinished by the
pencil, lay before me, colorless and undefined. But day by
day the outlines grew more complete, the figures assumed a
body, they lived—they moved—they uttered sounds; and
while to other eyes I was a solitary and hopeless fugitive
from human converse, to my own I was surrounded by a circle
of all that I loved, yet with a continued sense of privation, a
mysterious feeling of something imperfect in the indulgence
that dashed my cup with bitterness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Further
Wanders</div>

<p>With the increase of my strength, I became a wanderer to
great distances among the mountains. No persuasion of my
kinsmen could restrain me from those excursions. The mildness
of a climate in which the population sleep in the open
air, and the abundance of fruits, met the two chief difficulties
of traveling. I felt an irresistible impulse to penetrate the
mountain ranges that rose in chains of purple and azure before
me. With the artifice of the diseased mind, I made my
few preparations in secret, and with but scrip and staff,
marched forth to tread hill and valley, city and desert, were
it to the last limit of the globe.</p>

<p>Through what diversities of scene or impediments of road
I passed no recollection remains with me. The same instinct
which guides the bird led me to the fruit-tree and the stream,
taught me where to shelter for the night, and gave me sagacity
enough for the avoidance of the habitual dangers of a route
seldom tried but by the wolf and the robber.</p>

<p>My frame, gradually invigorated by exercise, bore me
through all, and I scaled the chain of Libanus with an unwearied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
foot. There I reached the skirts of a region where
the snow scarcely melts, even in the burning summer of Syria.
The falling of the leaf and the furious blasts that burst
through the ravines told me that I had spent months in my
pilgrimage, and that I must brave winter on its throne. Still
I persevered. I felt a new excitement in the new difficulty
of the season; I longed to try my power of endurance against
the storm, to wrestle with the whirlwind, to baffle the torrent.
The very sight of the snow, as it began to sheet the sides of
the lower hills, gave me a vague idea of a brighter realm of
existence; it united the pinnacles with the clouds; the noble
promontories and forest-covered eminences no longer rose in
stern contrast with the sky; they were dipped in celestial blue;
they wore the silvery and sparkling luster of the morning
skies; they blushed in the effulgence of the sunset, with as
rich a crimson as the cloud that crowned them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Sight of
the Groves of
Lebanon</div>

<p>But all was not fantastic vision. From the summit of one
of those hills I saw what was then worth a pilgrimage through
half the world to see, the cedar grove of Lebanon.<a name="ENanchor_21" id="ENanchor_21"></a><a href="#Endnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> After a
day of unusual fatigue and perplexity, I had found my path
blocked up by a perpendicular pile of rock. To all but myself
the difficulty might have been impracticable; but my
habits had given me the spring and sinew of a panther; I
bounded against the marble, and after long effort, by the help
of weeds and scattered roots of the wild vines, climbed my
perilous way to the summit. An endless range of Syria lay
beneath; the sea and the wilderness gleamed on my left and
right; and a rich succession of dells, crowded with the date,
the olive, and the grape, in their autumnal dyes, spread out
before me, as far as the eye could reach, in a land whose air
is pure as crystal.</p>

<p>A sound of trumpets and wild harmonies arose, and I discovered,
at an almost viewless depth below, a concourse of
people moving through the hollows of the mountains. The
tendency of man to man is irresistible; and that unexpected
sight, where but the wild beast and the eagle were to have
been my companions, gave me the first sensation of pleasure
that I had long experienced. Bounding from rock to rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with a hazardous rapidity which arrested the crowd in astonishment
and alarm, I joined them, just in time to see the
shafts and slings laid down, which they had prepared for my
coming, in the uncertainty whether I were a wolf or the leader
of a troop of mountain robbers!</p>

<div class="sidenote">On Scriptural
Ground</div>

<p>They formed one of the many caravans which annually
gathered from the shores of the Mediterranean to worship at
Lebanon. Their homage to sacred groves had been transmitted
from the earliest antiquity, and was universal in the realms of
paganism. To the Jew, worship on the hill and under the
tree was prohibited; but the forest that Solomon had chosen,
the trees of which the first Temple was built, the foliage
which shaded the first planters of the earth, must to the descendant
of Abraham be full of reverent interest. The ground
was Scriptural; the fiery string of the prophet Ezekiel had
been struck in its praise; the noblest raptures of our poets
celebrated the glory of Lebanon; the names of the surrounding
landscape recalled lofty and lovely memories; the vale of
<span class="smcap">Eden</span> led to the mountain of the Cedars!</p>

<p>To my fellow-travelers, traditions tinged by the fervid
coloring of the Oriental fancy heightened the native power
of the spot. On the summits of the trees were said to descend
at appointed times those ministering spirits whose purpose is
to rectify the ways of man. There stooped on the wing the
bearers of the sword against the evil monarchs; there brooded
the angel of the tempest; there the invisible ruler of the pestilence
blew with his breath and nations sickened; there, in
night and in the interval of storms, was heard the trumpet
that, before kings dreamed of quarrel, announced the collision
of guilty empires for their common ruin. The violation of
the grove was supposed to be visited with the most inexorable
calamity; the hand that cut down a tree for any ordinary use
withered from the body; all misfortunes fell upon the man;
his wealth disappeared, his children died in their prime;
if life was suffered to linger in himself, it was only to perpetuate
the warning of his punishment. Yet, there were gentler
distinctions mingled with those stern attributes. Above the
hill was the pagan entrance to the skies. Once in the year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the celestial gate rolled back on its golden hinges to sounds
surpassing mortal music; the heavens dropped balm; the
prayer offered on that night reached at once the supreme
throne; the tear was treasured in the volume of light, and
the worshiper who died before the envious coming of the
morn ascended to a felicity, earned by others only through
the tardy trial of the grave! Even the river, which ran
round the mountain’s foot, bore its share of virtue; its water,
unpolluted by the decays of autumn or the turbidness of
winter, showed the preservative power of a superior spell; it
was entitled the Holy Stream, and sealed vessels of its water
were sent even to India and Italy as presents of health and
sanctity to kings, gifts worthy of kings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Caravan of
Worshipers</div>

<p>When we entered the last defile, the minstrels and singers
of the caravan commenced a pæan. Altars fumed from various
points of the chasm above and the Syrian priests were
seen in their robes performing the empty rites of idolatry. I
turned away from this perversion of human reason, and pressed
forward through the lingering multitude until the forest rose
in its majesty before me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Woodland Temple</div>

<p>My step was now checked in solemn admiration. I saw the
earliest products of the earth—the patriarchs of the vegetable
world. The first generation of the reviving globe had sat
beneath these green and lovely arches; the final generation
was to sit beneath them. No roof so noble ever rose above
the heads of monarchs, tho it were covered with gold and
diamonds! The forest had been greatly impaired in its extent
and beauty by the sacrilegious hand of war. The perpetual
conflicts of the Syrian and Egyptian dynasties had laid the ax
to it with remorseless violation. It once spread over the
whole range of the mountains; its diminished strength now,
like the relics of a mighty army, made its stand among the
central fortresses of its native region; and there majestically
bade defiance to the further assault of steel and fire. The
forms of the trees seemed made for duration; the trunks were
of prodigious thickness, smooth and round as pillars of marble;
some rising to a great height, and throwing out a vast level
roof of foliage; some dividing into a cluster of trunks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with their various heights of branch and leaf making a succession
of verdurous caves; some propagating themselves by
circles of young cedars, risen where the fruit had dropped
upon the ground; the whole bearing the aspect of a colossal
temple of nature—the shafted column, the deep arch, the
solid buttresses, branching off into the richest caprices of Oriental
architecture, the solemn roof, high above, pale, yet
painted by the strong sunlight through the leaves with transparent
and tesselated dyes, various as the colors of the Indian
loom.</p>

<p>In the momentary feeling of awe and of wonder, I could
comprehend why paganism loved to worship under the shade
of forests and why the poets of paganism filled that shade
with the presence of deities. The airy whisperings, the deep
loneliness, the rich twilight, were the very food of mystery.
Even the forms that towered before the eye, those ancient
trees, the survivors of the general law of mortality, gigantic,
hoary, covered with their weedy robes, bowing their aged
heads in the blast, and uttering strange sounds and groanings
in the struggle, gave to the high-wrought superstition of the
time the images of things unearthly; the oracle, and the God!
Or, was this impression but the obscure revival of one of those
lovely truths that shone upon the days of Paradise when man
drew knowledge from its fount in nature, and all but his
own passions were disclosed to the first-born of creation?</p>

<p>The caravan encamped in the depth of the valley, and the
grove was soon crowded with worshipers, in whose homage I
could take no share. Fires were lighted on the large stones,
which had for ages served the purpose of altars; and the
names of the Syrian idols were shouted and sung in the fierce
exultation of a worship but slightly purified from its original
barbarism. As the night fell, I withdrew to the entrance of
the defile and gave a last glance at Lebanon. In the grove,
filled with fires, and echoing with wild music and dances of
riot, I saw the emblem of my fallen country; the holiness,
old as the memory of nations, profaned; yet the existence
preserved, and still to be preserved; Israel, once throned upon
its mountains, now diminished of its beauty, to be yet more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
diminished, but to live when all else perished; to be restored,
and to cover its native hills again with glory. I buried my
face in my robe, and throwing myself down by the skirt of
one of the tents, gave way to meditations, sweet and bitter.
They passed into my sleep and I was once more in the bosom
of my family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Demand</div>

<p>I heard my name pronounced! I listened; the name of
my wife followed. I looked to the sky, to the forest, to
convince me that this was no mockery of the diseased mind.
I was fully awake. I lifted up the corner of the tent. Savage
figures were sitting over their cups, inflamed into quarrel;
and, in the midst of high words and execrations, I heard
their story. They were robbers from Mount Amanus,<a name="ENanchor_22" id="ENanchor_22"></a><a href="#Endnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> come
equally to purify their hands by offering sacrifice at Lebanon,
and to recompense themselves for their lost time by robbing
on the way home. The quarrel had arisen from the proposal
of one of them to extend their expedition into Judea, a proposal
which he sustained by mentioning the success of his
previous enterprises. My name was again sent from mouth
to mouth, and I found that it was inscribed on some jewel
which formed a part of his plunder. The thought struck me
that this might afford a clue. I burst into the tent and demanded
tidings of my wife and children. The ruffians started,
as if in the presence of a specter.</p>

<p>“Where,” I repeated, “are my family? I am Salathiel!”</p>

<p>“Safe enough,” said the foremost.</p>

<p>“Are they alive?” I cried; “lead me where they are, and
you shall have whatever ransom you desire.”</p>

<p>The ruffian laughed. “Why, as for ransom, all the money
has been made by them that is likely to be made for some
time, unless the Greek that bought them repents of his
bargain.”</p>

<p>The speech was received with loud laughter. I grew furious.</p>

<p>“Villains, you have murdered them. Tell me the whole—show
me where they lie, or I will deliver you up to the chief
of the caravan as robbers and murderers.”</p>

<p>They were appalled; with a single stride I was at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
throat of the leading ruffian, and seized the jewel; it was my
bridal present to Miriam! My hand trembled, my eyes grew
dim at the glance. But in the next moment I found myself
pinioned, a gag forced into my mouth, a cloak flung over me,
and I heard the discussion—whether I was to be stabbed on
the spot, left to die of famine, or have my tongue cut out, and
thus unfitted for telling secrets, be turned to gain and sold
for a slave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Search
of a Family</div>

<p>But this was not to be my lot. The quarrel of the banditti
increased with their wine; blows were given; the solitary
lamp was thrown down in the conflict; it caught some combustible
matter, and the tent was in a blaze. By a violent exertion
I loosened the cords from my arms, and in the confusion
fled unseen. The fire spread, and my last glance at the valley
showed the encampment turned into a sheet of fire. Alone,
and exhausted with deadly fatigue, I yet had but one thought,
that of seeking my family through the world. I wandered
on through the vast range of wild country that guards Syria
on the side of the desert. I was parched by the burning noon,
I was frozen by the keen winds of night; I hungered and
thirsted, yet the determination was strong as death, and I
persevered. I at length reached the foot of Mount Amanus,
traversed the chain, saw from it the interminable plains of
Asia Minor, the desert of Aleppo, the shores of Tripoli, and
was then left only to choose in which I should again commence
my hopeless pilgrimage.</p>

<p>There is something in great distress of mind that throws a
strange protection round the sufferer. I passed the Roman
guards unquestioned—the robber left me without inquiring
whether I was worth his dagger. The wolves, driven down
by famine, and devouring all else that had life, neglected the
banquet that I might have supplied. Yet I shrank from
nothing, and marched on through city, cave and forest. But
one evening the sky was loaded with a tempest that drove
even me to seek for shelter. I found it in one of the caverns,
that so often scare the mariner’s eye, on the iron-bound shore
of Cilicia.</p>

<p>Fatigue soon threw me into a heavy slumber. The weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of the tempest toward midnight roused me, and from the mouth
of the cavern I gazed on the lightning that disclosed at every
explosion the sea rolling in foaming ridges before the gale.
In the intervals of the gusts I heard, to my surprise, the
murmur of many voices, apparently in prayer, close beside
me. But all my interest was suddenly fixed on the sea by
the sight of a large war-galley running before the wind. She
had neither sail nor oar. Her masts were gone and but for the
crowd of people on her deck, whose distracted attitudes I could
clearly see by the flashes, she looked a floating tomb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rescue
in a Tempest</div>

<p>To warn the galley of the nearness of the shore, I gathered
the brushwood beside me, and set it on fire. A shout from
the crew told that my signal was understood, and I rushed
down the bed of a stream that fretted its way through the
precipice. Before I reached the shore, I saw various fires
blazing above, and many figures hurrying down on a purpose
like my own. We had not arrived too soon. The galley,
after desperate efforts to keep the sea, had run for an inlet of
the rocks and was embayed; surge on surge, each higher
than the one before, now rolled over the ill-fated vessel, and
each swept some portion of her crew into the deep. We rushed
into the waves and had succeeded in drawing many to shore
when a broader burst, the concentrated force of the tempest,
thundered on the galley; she was broken into splinters.
Stunned and half-suffocated with the surge, I grasped, in the
mere instinct of self-preservation, at whatever was nearest
and, through infinite hazard, reached the shore with a body
in my arms. Need I tell my terror, anxiety, hope, and joy
when I found that this being, whom I saw at length breathing,
moving, pronouncing my name, falling on my neck, was
Miriam!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Among Robbers</div>

<p>My daughters, too, were rescued. The nearness of the
shore saved the crew, who, until they saw the fire on the
rocks, had given themselves up to despair. The chance of
help led them to steer close inland, and I was congratulated
as the general preserver. Miriam’s story was brief. Our
dwelling had been surrounded by a troop of robbers. The
household were surprised in their sleep. Resistance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
vain; the rest was plunder and captivity. The robbers, fearful
of pursuit, took the road to the mountains at full speed.
My wife and daughters were treated with unusual care, lest
their beauty should be injured, and thus their value in the
slave-market of Tripoli impaired. As the robber told me,
they had been purchased by a merchant of Cyprus, and by
him conveyed to his island to be sold to some more opulent
master. There they were redeemed by an act of equal generosity
and valor, and were returning to Judea when they
were overtaken by the storm.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Appeal of Miriam</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Changes
of Time</div>

<p>When the first tumult of our spirits was passed, I had
leisure to see what changes the interval had made in faces so
loved. Miriam’s betrayed the hours of distress and pain that
she must have passed through, but her noble style of beauty,
the emanation of a noble mind, was as conspicuous as ever. I
even thought, when her eyes met mine from time to time, that
they shone with a loftier intelligence, as if misfortune had
raised their vision above the things of our trivial world. My
daughters’ forms had matured, but Salome, the elder, had to
a certain degree her mother’s look; her glance was bright,
yet she was often lost in meditation, and the rapid changes of
her cheek from the deepest crimson to the whiteness of the
snow alarmed me with menaces of early decay. Esther, too,
had undergone her revolution. But it was of the brightest
texture. The seas, the skies, the mountains of Greece, filled
her glowing spirit with images of new life. She had listened
with boundless delight to the traditions of that most brilliant
of all people; the works of the pencil and the chisel had met
her eye in a profuseness and perfection that she had never
contemplated before; her harp had echoed to names of romantic
valor and proud patriotism; and as I gazed on her in those
hours when in the feeling that she was unobserved she gave
way to the rich impulses of her soul, I thought alternately of
the prophetess and of the muse.</p>

<p>The shipwreck converted the solitary shore into a little village;
the sailors collected the fragments of the vessel and
formed them into huts; the caves that ran along the level of
the sands supplied habitations in themselves, and by the assistance
of those dwellers on the precipice, who had so unexpectedly
started to light, the first difficulties of a wild coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
were sufficiently combated. The bustling activity of the
Greek mariners and the adroitness with which they availed
themselves of all contrivances for passing the heavy hour,
their sleights-of-hand, sports and dances, their recitations of
popular poems, and their boat-songs, kept the spot in continual
animation.</p>

<p>This was my first contact with the actual people, and I
acknowledged their right to have been distinguished among
the most showy disturbers of mankind. The evil of the character
too was displayed without much trouble of disguise.
They habitually gamed till they had no better stake than the
fragments of their own clothing; but they would game for a
shell, for a stone that they picked up on the sands, for anything.
They quarreled with as perfect facility as they gamed;
the knife was out quick as lightning, but to do them justice
their wrath was as brief. The combatants embraced at a
word, danced, kissed, and wept; then drank, gamed, quarreled,
and were sworn brothers again. But this was Greece in its
lowest rank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Meets
Constantius</div>

<p>Constantius, the commander of the galley, was a specimen
of the land which produced a Plato and a Pericles. When I
first saw him led to me by Miriam as the champion who had
restored her and her children to happiness, I saw virtue and
manliness of the highest order in his features. He was in his
prime, but a scar across his forehead and the severities of
martial life had given early seriousness to his countenance.
But his conversation had the full spirit of the spring-time of
life. It was incomparably various and animated, altogether
free from professional pedantry; it had the interest that belongs
to professional feelings. Military adventure, striking
traits of warlike intelligence, the composition of the fleets and
armies of the various states that fought under the wing of the
Roman eagle, were topics on which his fire was exhaustless.
On those I listened to him with the strong sympathy of one
to whom war must henceforth be the grand pursuit; war for
national freedom—war purified of its evil by the most illustrious
cause that ever unsheathed the sword.</p>

<p>He had conversation for us all. His intercourse with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
ruling lands of the earth gave him a copious store of recollections,
picturesque and strange. Esther combated and questioned
the traveler. Salome listened to the warrior—listened
and loved. He had higher topics of which I was yet to hear.
In the inhabitants of the precipice he found a little colony of
his countrymen, fugitive Christians driven out by persecution,
to make their home in the wilderness of nature.<a name="ENanchor_23" id="ENanchor_23"></a><a href="#Endnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The long
range of caverns which perforated the rock gave them a roof.
The fertility of the soil, and the occasional visit of a bark sent
by their concealed friends, supplied the necessaries of life,
and there they awaited the close of that ferocious tyranny
which at length roused the world against Nero—or awaited
the end of all suffering in the grave. A succession of storms
rendered traveling impossible and detained us among those
hermits for some days. I found them intelligent and, in general,
men of the higher ranks of knowledge and condition.
Some were of celebrated families, and had left behind them
opulence and authority. A few were peasants. But misfortune
and, still more, principle, extinguished all that was
abrupt in the inequality of ranks without leaving license in
its stead. Jew as I was, and steadily bound to the customs
of my country, I yet did honor to the patience, the humility,
and the devotedness of those exiled men. I even once attended
their worship on the first day of the week, assured
that the abomination of idols was not to be found there, and
that I should hear nothing insulting to the name of Israel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Simple
Worship</div>

<p>The ceremonial was simple. Those who had witnessed the
heaven-commanded magnificence of the Temple might smile
at the bareness of walls of rock, figured only with the wild
herbage; or those who had seen the extravagant and complicated
rites of paganism might scorn the few and obvious
forms of the homage. But there was the spirit of strong
prayer, the breathing of the heart, the unanswerable sincerity.
Every violence of the mere animal frame was unknown.
I saw no pagan convulsion, no fierceness of outcry and gesture,
not even the vehement solemnity of the Jew. All was
calm; tears stole down, but they stole in silence; knees were
bowed, but there was no prostration; prayers fervent and lofty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
were poured forth, but they were in accents uttered less from
the lip than from the soul—appeals of hallowed confidence,
as to a Being who was sure to hear the voice of children to a
Father who, wherever two or three were gathered together,
was in the midst of them.</p>

<p>At length the storms cleared away and the sky wore the
native azure of the climate. A messenger despatched to
Cyprus returned with a vessel for the embarkation of the
Greeks. Camels and mules were procured from the neighboring
country for our journey, and the morning was fixed on
which we were to separate. Yet with so much reason for joy,
few resolutions could have been received with less favor.
Constantius almost shunned society or shared in it with a
silence and depression that made his philosophy more than
questionable. Miriam was engaged in long conferences with
Salome, from which they both came away much saddened.
Esther was thus my chief companion, and she talked of the
shore, the sea, and even of the tempests, with heightened interest.
The Greeks, sailor and soldier alike, loved too well
the romantic ease and careless adventure of the place to look
with complacency on the little vessel in which they were to
be borne once more into the land of restraint. The fugitive
colony were not the slowest in their regrets. They had been
deeply prepared for human vicissitudes, and had humbled
themselves to all things; yet such is the strong and natural
connection of man with man that they lamented the solitude
to which they must again be left, like the commencement of
a new exile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Moment of
Departure</div>

<p>There are few things more singular than the blindness which,
in matters of the highest importance to ourselves, often hides
the truth that is as plain as noon to all other eyes. The cause
which had deprived Constantius of his eloquence and Salome
of her animation was obvious to every one but me. Nor was
the mystery yet to be disclosed to my tardy knowledge. I
had strayed through the cliffs, as was my custom after the
heat of the day, and was taking a last look at the sea from
the edge of the precipice. The sands far below me were
covered with preparations for the voyage, which, like our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
journey, was to commence with the rising sun. The little
vessel lay, a glittering toy, at anchor with her thread-like
streamers playing in the breeze. The sailors were fishing,
preparing their evening meal, heaving water and provisions
down the rocks, or enjoying themselves over flagons of Syrian
wine round their fires. All was the activity of a seaport, but
from the height on which I stood, all was but the activity of
a mole-hill.</p>

<p>“And is it of such materials,” mused I, “that ambition is
made? Is it to command, to be gazed on, to be shouted after
by such mites and atoms as those, that life is exhausted in
watching and weariness; that our true enjoyments are sacrificed;
that the present and the future are equally cast from
us; that the hand is dipped in blood and the earth desolated?
What must Alexander’s triumph have looked to one who
saw it from the towers of Babylon? A triumph of emmets!”
I smiled at the moral of three hundred feet of precipice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Alone
with Miriam</div>

<p>A step beside me put my philosophy to flight. My wife
stood there, and never saw I her beauty more beautiful. The
exertion of the ascent had colored her cheek; the breeze had
scattered her raven locks across a forehead of the purest
white; her lips wore the smile so long absent, and there was
altogether an air of hope and joy in her countenance that
made me instinctively ask of what good news she was the
bearer. Without a word, she sat down beside me and pressed
my hand; she fixed her eyes on mine, tried to speak, and
failing, fell on my neck and burst into tears. Alarmed by
her sobs and the wild beating of her heart, I was about to rise
for assistance when she detained me, and the smile returned;
she bared her forehead to the breeze, and recovering, disburdened
her soul.</p>

<p>“How many billows,” said she, gazing on the sea, “will
roll between that little bark and this shore to-morrow! There
is always something melancholy in parting. Yet if that vessel
could feel, with what delight would she not wing her way to
Cyprus, lovely Cyprus!”</p>

<p>I was surprised. “Miriam! this from you? Can you
regret the place of paganism—the land of your captivity?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” was the answer, with a look of lofty truth; “I abhorred
the guilty profanations of the pagan; and who can
love the dungeon? Even were Cyprus a paradise, I should
have felt unhappy in the separation from my country and
from you. Yet those alone who have seen the matchless
loveliness of the island—the perpetual animation of life in a
climate and in the midst of scenes made for happiness—can
know the sacrifice that must be made by its people in leaving
it, and leaving it perhaps forever.”</p>

<p>“The crew of that galley are not to be tried by long exile.
In two days at furthest, they will anchor in their own harbour,”
was my only answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miriam Speaks
of Constantius</div>

<p>“And how deeply must the sacrifice be enhanced by the
abandonment of rank, wealth, professional honors!—and this
is the sacrifice on which I have been sent to consult my husband.”</p>

<p>I was totally at a loss to conceive of whom she spoke.</p>

<p>“Our friend—our deliverer from captivity or death—the
generous being who, through infinite hazards, restored your
wife and children to happiness and home——”</p>

<p>“Constantius? Impossible! At the very age of ambition,
with his talents, his knowledge of life, his prospects of distinction!”</p>

<p>“Constantius will never return to Cyprus in that galley—will
never draw sword for Rome again—will never quit the
land given by Heaven to our fathers, if such be the will of
Salathiel.”</p>

<p>“Strange. But his motives? He is superior to the fickleness
that abandons an honorable course of life through the
pure love of novelty—or is he weary of the absurdities of
paganism?”</p>

<p>“Thoroughly weary—more than weary: he has abjured
them forever and ever.”</p>

<p>“You rejoice me. But it was to be expected from his
manly mind. You have brought an illustrious convert, my
beloved! and if your captivity has done this, it was the will
of Heaven. Constantius shall be led with distinction to the
Temple and be one of ourselves. Judea may yet require such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
men. Our holy religion may exult in such conquests from the
darkness of the idolatrous world.”</p>

<p>The voice of the hermits at their evening prayer now arose
and held us in a silence which neither seemed inclined to
break. Many thoughts pressed on my mind: the addition to
our circle of a man whom I honored and esteemed; the accession
of a practised soldier to our cause; the near approach
of the hour of conflict; the precarious fate of those I loved in
the great convulsion which was to rend away the Roman yoke
or leave Judea a tomb. I accidentally looked up and saw that
Miriam had been as abstracted as myself. But war and
policy were not in the contemplations of the beaming countenance;
nor their words on the lips that quivered and crimsoned
before me. Her eyes were fixed on the sky, and she was in
evident prayer, which I desired not to disturb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miriam’s
Candor</div>

<p>She at length caught my glance and blushed like one detected;
but quickly recovering, said in a tone never to be
forgotten: “My husband! my lord! my love! would that I
dared open my whole spirit to you! would that you could
read for yourself the truths written in my heart!”</p>

<p>“Miriam!”</p>

<p>“This is no reproach. But I know your strength of opinion—your
passion for all that concerns the glory of Israel;
your right, the right of talents and character to the foremost
rank among the priesthood—and those things repel me.”</p>

<p>“Speak out at once. We can have no concealments,
Miriam; candor, candor in all things.”</p>

<p>“You have heard the prayers of those exiles; you acknowledge
their acquirements and understandings; they have sacrificed
much, everything—friends, country, the world. Can
such men have been imposed on? Can they have imposed on
themselves? Is it possible that their sacrifices could have
been made for a fiction?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; the question is difficult. We are strangely
the slaves of impulse. Men every day abandon the most
obvious good for the most palpable follies. Enthusiasm is a
minor madness.”</p>

<p>“But are those exiles enthusiasts? They are grave men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
experienced in life; their language is totally free from extravagance;
they reason with singular clearness; they live
with the most striking command over the habits of their
original condition. Greeks as they are, you see no haste of
temper, you hear no violence of language among them. Once
idolaters, they shrink from the thought of idols. Now fugitive
and persecuted, they pray for their persecutors. Sharing
the lair of wild beasts, and driven out from all that they
knew and loved, they utter no complaint—they even rejoice
in their calamity and offer up praises to the mercy that shut
the gates of earth upon their steps, only to open the gates of
heaven.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hope
of Israel</div>

<p>“I am no persecutor, Miriam. Nay, I honor the self-denial,
as I doubt not the sincerity of those men. But if they
have thrown off a portion of their early blindness, why not
desire the full illumination? Why linger half-way between
falsehood and truth? It is not, as you know, our custom to
solicit proselytes. But such men might be not unworthy of
the hope of Israel.”</p>

<p>“It is to the hope of Israel that they have come, that they
cling, that they look up for a recompense—a glorious recompense
for their sufferings.”</p>

<p>“Let them then join us at sunrise, and come to our holy
city.”</p>

<p>“Salathiel, the time is declared when men shall worship
not in that mountain alone, but through all lands; when the
yoke of our law shall be lightened and the weary shall have
rest; when the altar shall pass away as the illustrious victim
has passed, and the wisdom of heaven shall be the possession
of all mankind.”</p>

<p>I looked at her in astonishment. “Miriam, this from you!
from a daughter of the blood of Jacob! from the wife of a
servant of the Temple! Have you become a Christian?”</p>

<p>“I have done nothing in presumption. I have prayed to
the Source of light that He would enlighten my understanding;
I have, night and day, examined the law and the prophets.
Bear with my weakness, Salathiel, if it be proved weakness.
But if it be wisdom, knowledge, and truth, I implore you by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
our love, nay, by the higher interests of your own soul,
follow my example.”</p>

<p>It was impossible to answer harshly to a remonstrance expressed
with the overflowing fondness of the heart: I could
only remind her of the unchangeable promises made to Judaism.</p>

<p>“But it is of those promises I speak,” urged she; “we have
seen the day that our father Abraham longed to see; that
mighty Being, the Lord of eternity, the express image of the
glory of the Invisible, the hope of the patriarch, the promise
of the prophet, has come.”</p>

<p>I was alarmed.</p>

<p>“Yet Israel is divided and enslaved, torn by capricious
tyranny, and hurrying to the common ruin of doomed nations.
Is this the triumphant kingdom of prophecy?”</p>

<p>“Salathiel, I have doubted like you; but I have been at
length convinced out of the mouths of the prophets themselves.
Have they not declared that Israel should suffer before
it triumphed, and suffer too for a period that strikes the
mind with terror? that the King of Israel should be excluded
from his kingdom—nay, take upon him the form of a servant—nay,
die, and die by a death of pain and shame the death
of a slave and criminal?”</p>

<p>“It is so written. But it is beyond our power to reconcile.”</p>

<p>“Pray then for the power, and it will be given to you.
Ask for the spirit of holy intelligence, and it will enlighten
you. Pride is the crime of our nation. Humility would take
the veil from the eyes of our people. Salathiel, my lord, the
being treasured in my heart! read the Scriptures. I have
prayed for you. Read——”</p>

<p>“But how can the promise of the kingdom be denied? It
is the theme first, last, and without end of all the inspired
masters of Israel. What splendor and reality of history was
ever more vivid and real than the glorious promises of Isaiah?”
I murmured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Coming of
the Messiah</div>

<p>“Yet what force and minuteness of picturing ever excelled
Isaiah’s description of the lowliness, the obscurity, the rejection,
the agonies, and the death of the Messiah? Why shall
we suppose that the one description is true and the other false?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Has not the same inspiration given both? Why shall we
conceive that the Messiah and His kingdom must appear together?
We see the time of His first coming defined to a year,
by our great prophet Daniel. But where do we see the time
of the triumphant kingdom defined? Why may it not follow
at a distance of ages? We know that we shall stand at the
latter day upon the earth and in our flesh shall see God. Why
shall not the triumph be reserved for that day of glory? Are
our people now fit to be a nation of kings? Or are the best
of us, in the mortal feebleness of our nature, fit to share in a
triumph in which angels are to minister? fit dwellers of a city
from which error and evil are to be excluded; in which there
is to be no tear, no human suffering, no remembered bitterness;
‘a city whose builder and maker is God’; within whose
walls live holiness, power, and virtue; on whose throne sits
the Omnipotent!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Considers
Paganism</div>

<p>Sensations to which I dared not give utterance oppressed
me; my crime, my fate, rose up before the mental eye. I
had no answer for this admirable woman. Her pure zeal and
her holiness of heart touched me deeply. But let no man
blame my stubbornness until he has weighed the influence of
feelings, born in a people, strengthened by their history,
reenforced by miracle, and authenticated by the words of inspiration.
That Judaism was purity itself to the worship and
morals of the pagan world, that it was the continued object
of a particular Providence, that it alone possessed the revelations
of God, were facts that defied doubt. And that those
high distinctions should be made void, and the slavish mind
of paganism be admitted into our privileges—still more, that
it should be admitted to the exclusion of the chosen line—seemed
to me a conclusion that no reasoning could substantiate;
a fantastic and airy fiction to which no reasoning could
be applied.</p>

<p>The moon ascended in serenity, and her orb, slightly tinged
by the many-colored clouds that lay upon the horizon, threw
a faint silver upon the precipice. The sounds below were
hushed; the moving figures, the vessel, the sea, the cliffs,
were totally veiled in purple mist. We could not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
more alone if we had been seated on a cloud, and the beauty,
the exalted gesture, and the glowing wisdom of the being before
me were like those that we conceive of spirits delegated
to lead the disembodied mind upward from world to world.
A sea-bird winging its way above our heads broke the reverie.
I reminded my teacher that it grew late and our absence
might produce anxiety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Secret of a
Scroll</div>

<p>“Salathiel,” said she, with mingled fervor and softness,
“you know I love you; never was heart more fondly bound
to another than is mine to you. I am grateful for your permission
to receive Constantius into our tribe. But one obligation,
infinitely dearer, you can confer on me—read this scroll.”
She drew from her bosom a letter, written to his church by
one of the Christian leaders in Asia. “I desire not to offend
your convictions, nor to hasten you into a rash adoption of
those of others. But in this scroll you will find philosophy
without its pride, and knowledge without its guile; you will
find, furthermore, the disclosure of those mysteries which have
so long perplexed our people. Read, and may He who can
bring wisdom out of the lips of babes, and make the wisdom
of the wise foolishness, shed His light upon the generous heart
of my husband!”</p>

<p>At another time I might have started in horror from this
avowal of her faith. But the scene, the circumstances, an
unaccountable internal impression—a voice of the soul, prohibited
me. I took her trembling hand, and without a word
led her down to our dwelling.</p>

Again Travels
Homeward</div>

<p>No tidings sooner make themselves known than those of the
heart. We found our daughters waiting anxiously at the entrance
of the cave, which had been fitted up for our temporary
shelter. Before a word could be exchanged, a glance from
Miriam told the success of her mission, and anxiety was
turned into delight. Esther danced round me and was eloquent
in her gratitude. Salome shed silent tears, and when
I attempted to wipe them away, fell fainting into my arms.
We spent a part of the night in the open air; the last wine
and fruits of our store were brought out; the Cypriot exiles
came down from their rocks; the crew of the galley, already
on board, danced, sang, and drank to the success of the voyage;
and it was not till the moon, our only lamp, was about
to be extinguished in the waters, that we thought of closing
our final night on the Syrian shore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Surprising Change</div>

<p>We traveled along the coast as far as Berytus; then turning
to the eastward, crossed the Libanus and the mountain
country that branches into Upper Galilee. Our coming had
been long announced, and we found Eleazar, Jubal, and our
chief kinsmen waiting at one of the passes to lead us home in
triumph. The joy of our tribe was honest if it was tumultuous,
and many a shout disturbed the solitude as we moved
along. My impatience increased when we reached the well-known
hills that sheltered what was once my home. Yet I
remembered too keenly the shock of seeing its desolation not
to dread the first sight of the spot, and rode away from the
group at full speed that my nervousness might have time to
subside before their arrival. But at the foot of the last ascent
I drew the rein. Every tree, every bush, almost every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
stone, had been familiar to me in my wanderings, and were
now painful memorials of the long malady of my mind.</p>

<p>Eleazar, who watched me during the latter part of the
journey with something of a consciousness of my thoughts,
put spurs to his horse, and found me standing, pale and
palpitating.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, “we must not alarm Miriam by thinking
too much of the past; let us try if the top of the hill will not
give us a better prospect than the bottom.”</p>

<p>I shrank from the attempt.</p>

<p>“No!” said I; “the horror that the prospect once gave
me must not be renewed. Let us change the route, no matter
how far round; the sight of that ruin would distract me to
the last hour of my life.”</p>

<p>He only smiled in reply, and catching my bridle, galloped
forward. A few seconds placed us on the summit of the hill.
Could I believe my eyes! All below was as if rapine had
never been there. The gardens, the cattle, the dwellings, lay
a living picture under the eye.</p>

<p>“This is miracle!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No; or it is but the miracle of a little activity and a
great deal of good will,” was the answer of my companion.
“Your kinsmen did this at the time when you were slumbering
with the wolf and bear in the Libanus; Nature did her
part in covering your fields and gardens; and those sheep and
cattle are a tribute of gratitude from your brother for the preservation
of his life.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Policy of Rome</div>

<p>Our troop now ascended the height. The land lay beneath
them in the luxuriance of summer. They were ardent in their
expressions of surprise and pleasure. We rushed down the
defile, and I was once more master of a home. Public events
had rapidly ripened in my absence.<a name="ENanchor_24" id="ENanchor_24"></a><a href="#Endnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Popular wrath was
stimulated by increased exaction. Law was more palpably
perverted into insolence. Order was giving way on all sides.
The Roman garrisons, neglected and ill paid, were adopting
the desperate habits of the populace, and in the general scorn
of religion and right, the country was becoming a horde of
robbers. The ultimate causes of this singular degeneracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
might be remote and set in action by a vengeance above man;
but the immediate causes were plain to every eye.</p>

<p>The general principles of Rome in the government of her
conquests were manly and wise. When the soldier had done
his work—and it was done vigorously, yet with but little violence
beyond that which was essential for complete subjugation—the
sword slept as an instrument of evil, and awoke
only as an instrument of justice.</p>

<p>If neighboring kingdoms quarreled, a legion marched
across the border and brought the belligerents to sudden
reason; dismissed their armies to their hearths and altars,
and sent the angry chiefs to reconcile their claims in an
Italian dungeon. If a disputed succession threatened to embroil
the general peace, the proconsul ordered the royal competitors
to embark for Rome, and there settle the right before
the senate.</p>

<p>The barbaric invasions which had periodically ravaged the
Eastern empires even in their day of power were repelled
with a terrible vigor. The legions left the desert covered
with the tribe for the feast of the vulture, and showed to
Europe the haughty leaders of the Tatar, Gothic, and Arab
myriads in fetters, dragging wains, digging in mines, or
sweeping the highways.</p>

<p>If peace could be an equivalent for freedom, the equivalent
was never so amply secured. The world within this iron
boundary nourished; the activity and talent of man were
urged to the highest pitch; the conquered countries were
turned from wastes and forests into fertility; ports were dug
upon naked shores; cities swelled from villages; population
spread over the soil once pestilential and breeding only the
weed and the serpent. The sea was covered with trade; the
pirate and the marauder were unheard of or hunted down.
Commercial enterprise shot its lines and communications over
the map of the earth, and regions were then familiar which
even the activity of the revived ages of Europe has scarcely
made known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Absence of Genius</div>

<p>Those were the wonders of great power steadily directed to
a great purpose. General coercion was the simple principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and the only talisman of a Roman Emperor was the chain,
except where it was casually commuted for the sword; the
universality of the compression atoned for half its evil. The
natural impulse of man is to improvement; he requires only
security from rapine. The Roman supremacy raised round
him an impregnable wall. It was the true government for an
era when the habits of reason had not penetrated the general
human mind. Its chief evil was in its restraint of those
nobler and loftier aspirations of genius and the heart which
from time to time raise the general scale of mankind.</p>

<p>Nothing is more observable than the decay of original
literature, of the finer architecture and of philosophical invention,
under the empire. Even military genius, the natural
product of a system that lived but on military fame, disappeared;
the brilliant diversity of warlike talent that shone on
the very verge of the succession of the Cæsars sank like falling
stars, to rise no more. No captain was again to display
the splendid conception of Pompey’s boundless campaigns;
the lavish heroism and inexhaustible resource of Antony; or
the mixture of undaunted personal enterprise and profound
tactic, the statesmanlike thought, generous ambition, and
high-minded pride that made Cæsar the very emblem of Rome.
But the imperial power had the operation of one of those
great laws of nature which through partial evil sustain the
earth—a gravitating principle which, if it checked the ascent
of some gifted beings beyond the dull level of life, yet kept
the infinite multitude of men and things from flying loose
beyond all utility and all control.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman Avarice</div>

<p>Yet it was only for a time. The empire was but the superstructure
of the republic, a richer, more luxuriant, and more
transitory object for the eye of the world, and the storm was
already gathering that was to shake it to the ground. The
corruptions of the palace first opened the imperial ruin.
They soon extended through every department of the state.
If the habitual fears of the tyrant in the midst of a headlong
populace could scarcely restrain him in Rome, what must
be the excesses of his minions where no fear was felt, where
complaint was stifled by the dagger, and where the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was bought with bribes, to be replaced only by licensed
rapine!</p>

<p>The East was the chief victim. The vast northern and
western provinces of the empire pressed too closely on Rome,
were too poor and too warlike to be the favorite objects of
Italian rapacity. There a new tax raised an insurrection;
the proconsular demand of a loan was answered by a flight
which stripped the land, or by the march of some unheard-of
tribe, pouring down from the desert to avenge their countrymen.
The character, too, of the people, influenced the choice
of their governors. Brave and experienced soldiers, not
empty and vicious courtiers, must command the armies that
were thus liable to be hourly in battle, and on whose discipline
depended the slumbers of every pillow in Italy. Stern as is
the life of camps, it has its virtues, and men are taught consideration
for the feelings, rights, and resentments of man by
a teacher that makes its voice heard through the tumult of
battle and the pride of victory. But all was reversed in Asia,
remote, rich, habituated to despotism, divided in language,
religion, and blood; with nothing of that fierce, yet generous
clanship, which made the Gaul of the Belgian marshes listen
to the trumpet of the Gaul of Narbonne, and the German of
the Vistula burn with the wrongs of the German of the Rhine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Discovery of Danger</div>

<p>Under Nero, Judea was devoured by Roman avarice. She
had not even the sad consolation of owing her evils to the
ravage of those nobler beasts of prey in human shape that
were to be found in the other provinces—she was devoured by
locusts. The polluted palace supplied her governors; a slave
lifted into office by a fellow slave; a pampered profligate,
exhausted by the expenses of the capital; a condemned and
notorious extortioner, with no other spot to hide his head,
were the gifts of Nero to my country. Pilate, Felix, Festus,
Albinus, Florus, a race more profligate and cruel as our catastrophe
approached, tore the very bowels of the land. Of the
last two it was said that Albinus should have been grateful
to Florus for proving that he was not the basest of mankind,
by the evidence that a baser existed; that he had a respect
for virtue by his condescending to commit those robberies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in private which his successor committed in public; and that
he had human feeling by his abstaining from blood where
he could gain nothing by murder; while Florus disdained
alike concealment and cause, and slaughtered for the public
pleasure of the sword!</p>

<p>A number of partial insurrections, easily suppressed, displayed
the wrath of the people and indulged the cruelty of
the procurator. They indulged also his avarice. Defeat was
followed by confiscation; and Florus even boasted that he desired
nothing more prosperous than insurrection in every village
of Judea. He was about to be gratified before he had
prepared himself for this luxury!</p>

<p>A menial in my house was detected with letters from an
agent of the Roman governor. They required details of my
habits and resources, which satisfied me that I had become an
object of vengeance. From the time of my return I had seen
with bitterness of soul the insults to my country. I had
summoned my friends to ascertain what might be our means
of resistance, and found them as willing and devoted as became
men; but our resources for more than the first burst of
popular wrath, the seizure of some petty Roman garrison, or
the capture of a convoy, were nothing. The jealousies of the
chief men of the tribes, the terrors of Rome, the positions of
the Roman troops, cutting off military communication between
the north and south of Judea, made the attempt hopeless, and
it was abandoned for the time. Even those letters which
marked me for a victim made no change in my determination
that if I could not escape danger by individual means, no
public blood should be laid to my charge. For a few months
all was tranquil; the habits of rural life are calculated to keep
depressing thoughts at a distance. My wife and daughters
returned to their graceful pursuits, with the added pleasure
of novelty after so long a cessation. I hunted through the
hills with Constantius, or, traversing the country which
might yet be the scene of events, availed myself of the knowledge
of a master of the whole science of Roman war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Love for History</div>

<p>At home the works of the great poets of the West, with
whom our guest had made us familiar, varied the hours; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
I found a still more stirring and congenial interest in the histories
of Greek valor, and in the study of the mighty minds
that made and unmade empires.</p>

<p>With the touching and picturesque narrative of Herodotus
in my hand, I pantingly followed the adventures of the most
brilliant of nations. I fought the battle with them against
the Persian; I saw them gathered in little startled groups on
the hills, or flying in their little galleys from island to island,
the land deserted, the sea covered with fugitives; the Persian
fleets loaded with Asiatic pomp, darkening the waters like a
thunder-cloud—and in a moment all changed! The millions
of Asia scattered like dust before the wind—Greece lifted to
the height of martial glory, and commencing a career of
triumph still more illustrious, that triumph of the mind in
which, through the remotest vicissitudes of earth, she was to
have no conqueror.</p>

<p>I especially and passionately pursued the campaigns of that
extraordinary man Arrian, whose valor, vanity, and fortune
make him one of the landmarks of human nature. In Alexander
I delighted in tracing the native form of the Greek
through the embroidered robes of royalty and triumph. In
his romantic intrepidity and deliberate science, his alternations
of profound thought and fantastic folly, the passion for praise
and the contempt for its offerers, the rash temper and the
noble magnanimity, the love for the arts and the thirst for
that perpetual war before which they fly, the philosophic
scorn of privation and the feeble lapses into self-indulgence;
the generous forecast, which peopled deserts and founded
cities, and the giddy and fatal neglect which left his diadem
to be fought for and his family to be the prey of rival rebellions,—I
saw the true man of the republic; not the lord of the
rugged hills of Macedon, but the Athenian of the day of
popular splendor and folly, with only the difference of the
scepter.</p>

<p>To me those studies were like a new door opened into the
boundless palace of human nature. I felt that sense of
novelty, vigor, and fresh life that the frame feels in breathing
the morning air over the landscape of a new country. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a voyage on an unknown sea, where every headland administers
to the delight of curiosity. In this there was nothing
of the common pedantry of the schools. My knowledge of
life had hitherto been limited by my original destination. A
Jew and a priest, there was but one solemn avenue through
which I was to see the glimpses of the external world. The
vista was now opened beyond all limit; visions of conquest,
of honor among nations, of praise to the last posterity, clustered
round my head. There were times when in this exultation
even my doom was forgotten. The momentary oblivion
may have been permitted merely to blunt the edge of incurable
misfortune. I was permitted at intervals to recruit the
strength that was to be tried till the end of time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eleazar’s
Disclosure</div>

<p>I was one day immersed in Polybius, with my master in
soldiership at my side, guiding me by his living comment
through the wonders of the Punic campaigns, when Eleazar
entered, with a look that implied his coming on a matter of
importance. Constantius rose to withdraw.</p>

<p>“No,” said my brother, “the subject of my mission is one
that should not be concealed from the preserver of our
kindred. It may be one of happiness to us all. Salome has
arrived at the age when the daughters of Israel marry. She
must give way to our general wish and play the matron at
last.”</p>

<p>He turned with a smile to Constantius, and asked his assent
to the opinion; he received no answer. The young Greek
had plunged more deeply than ever into the passage of the
Alps.</p>

<p>“And who is the suitor?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“One worthy of her and you. A generous, bold, warm-hearted
kinsman, in the spring of life, sufficiently opulent, for
he will probably be my heir, prepared to honor you, and, I
believe, long and deeply attached to her.”</p>

<p>“Jubal! There is not a man in our tribe to whom I would
more gladly give her. Let my friend Jubal come. Congratulate
me, Constantius; you shall now at last see festivity in
our land in scorn of the Roman. You have seen us in flight
and captivity; you shall now witness some of the happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that was in Judah before we knew the flapping of an Italian
banner, and which shall be, if fortune smile, when Rome is
like Babylon.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jubal’s
Cause</div>

<p>Constantius suddenly rose from his volume, and thrusting
it within the folds of his tunic, was leaving the apartment.</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “you must remain; Miriam and Salome shall
be sent for, and in your presence the contract signed.”</p>

<p>For the first time I perceived the excessive pallidness of his
countenance, and asked whether I had not trespassed too much
on his patience with my studies.</p>

<p>His only reply was: “Is there no liberty of choice in the
marriages of Israel? Will you decide without consulting her,
whom this contract is to render happy or miserable while she
lives?” He rushed from the room.</p>

<p>Miriam came—but alone. Her daughter had wandered out
into one of our many gardens. She received Eleazar with
sisterly fondness, but her features wore the air of constraint.
She heard the mission, but “she had no opinion to give in the
absence of Salome. She knew too well the happiness of having
chosen for herself to wish to force the consent of her
child. Let Salome be consulted.”</p>

<p>The flourish of music and the trampling of horses broke
up our reluctant conference. Jubal had already come with
a crowd of his friends. We hastened to receive him at the
porch, and he bounded into the court on his richly caparisoned
barb, at the head of a troop in festal habiliments.</p>

<p>The men of Israel loved pomp of dress and handsome steeds.
The group before me might have made a body-guard for a
Persian king. Jubal had long looked on my daughter with
the admiration due to her singular beauty; it was the custom
to wed within our tribe; he was the favorite and the heir of
her uncle; she had never absolutely banished him from her
presence, and in the buoyancy of natural spirits, the boldness
of a temperament born for a soldier, and perhaps in the allowable
consciousness of a showy form, he had admitted none
of the perplexities of a trembling lover. Salome was at length
announced, and the proposed husband was left to plead his
own cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Overhears
Salome</div>

<p>We received the friends of our intended son with the accustomed
hospitality, but to me the tumult of many voices,
and even the sight of a crowd, however happy, still excited
the old disturbances of a shaken mind.</p>

<p>I left my guests to the care of Eleazar, and galloped into
the fields to gather composure from the air of fruits and
flowers. A homeward glance showed me, to my surprise, the
whole troop mounted, and in another moment at speed across
the hills. I hastened back. Miriam met me. My kinsman
had openly disclaimed my alliance.</p>

<p>Indignant and disappointed, I prepared to follow him and
demand the cause of this insult. As I passed one of the
pavilions, my daughter’s voice arrested me. She was talking
to Constantius. Scorning mere curiosity, I yet was anxious
for sincere explanation. I felt that if Salome had a wish
which she feared to divulge to her father, this was my only
hope of obtaining the knowledge. The voices were low, and
I could, for a while, catch but a broken sentence.</p>

<p>“I owed it to him,” said she, “not to deceive his partiality.
He offered all that it could have done a Jewish maiden honor
to receive—his heart, hand, and fortune.”</p>

<p>“And you rejected them all?” said Constantius. “Have
you no regrets for the lover—no fears of the father?”</p>

<p>“For the lover I had too high an esteem to give him a
promise which I could not keep. I knew his generous nature.
I told him at once that there was an invincible obstacle!”</p>

<p>“I should like incomparably to know what that obstacle
could be?” said Constantius.</p>

<p>Astonishment fixed me to the spot. I was unable to move
a step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius and
Salome</div>

<p>The natural playfulness of the sweet and light-hearted girl
became manifest, and she replied “that a philosopher ought
to know all things without questioning.”</p>

<p>“But there is much in the world that defies philosophy, my
fair Salome; and of all its problems, the most perplexing is
the mind of woman!—of young, lovely, dangerous woman!”</p>

<p>“Now, Constantius, you abandon the philosopher and play
the poet.”</p>

<p>“Yet without the poet’s imagination. No; I need picture
no beauty from the clouds—no nymph from the fountains—no
loveliness that haunts the trees, and breathes more than
mortal melody on the ear. Salome! my muse is before me.”</p>

<p>“You are a Greek,” said she, after a slight interval, “and
Greeks are privileged to talk—and to deceive.”</p>

<p>“Salome! I am a Greek no longer. What I shall yet be
may depend upon the fairest artist that ever fashioned the
human mind. But mine are not the words of inexperience.
I am on this day five-and-twenty years old. My life has led
me into all that is various in the intercourse of earth. I have
seen woman in her beauty, in her talent, in her art, in her
accomplishment; from the cottage to the throne—but I never
felt her real power before.”</p>

<p>“Which am I to believe—the possible or the impossible?
A soldier! a noble! a Greek! and of all Greeks, one of
Cyprus! the offerer of your eloquence at every shrine where
your own lovely countrywomen stood by the altar!—I too
have seen the world.”</p>

<p>“May all the Graces forbid that you should ever see it, but
what it would be made by such as you—a place of gentleness
and harmony—a place of fondness and innocence—a paradise!”</p>

<p>“Now you are further from the philosopher than ever; but—I
must listen no more; the sun is taking its leave of us, and
blushing its last through the vines for all the fine romance
that it has heard from Constantius. Farewell, philosophy.”</p>

<p>“Then farewell, philosophy,” said Constantius, and caught
her hand as she was lightly moving from the pavilion. He
led her toward the casement. “Then farewell, philosophy,
my sweet; and welcome truth, virtue, and nature. I loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
you in your captivity; I loved you in your freedom; on the
sea, on the shore, in the desert, in your home, I loved you.
In life I will love you, in death we shall not be divided.
This is not the language of mere admiration, the rapture of a
fancy dazzled by the bright eyes of my Salome. It is the
language of reason, of sacred truth, of honor bound by higher
than human bonds; of fondness that even the tomb will
render only more ardent and sublime. Here, in the sight of
Heaven, I pledge an immortal to an immortal.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Love
of Constantius</div>

<p>Astonishment and grief alone prevented my exclaiming
aloud against this bond on the affections of my child. The
marriage of the Israelite with the stranger was prohibited by
our law, and still more severely prohibited by the later ordinances
of our teachers. But marriage with a fugitive, an
alien, a son of the idolater, whose proselytism had never been
avowed, and whose skill in the ways of the world might be at
this hour undermining the peace or the faith of my whole
family—the idea was tenfold profanation! I checked myself
only to have complete evidence.</p>

<p>“But,” said my daughter, in a voice mingled with many
a sigh, “if this should become known to my father—and
known it must be—how can we hope for his consent? Now,
Constantius, you will have to learn what it is to deal with
our nation. We have prejudices, lofty, tho blind—indissoluble,
tho fantastic. My father’s consent is beyond all
hope.”</p>

<p>“He is honorable—he has human feeling—he loves you.”</p>

<p>“Fondly, I believe, and I must not thus return his love;
no, tho my happiness were to be the forfeit, I must not pain
his heart by the disobedience of his child.”</p>

<p>“But Salome, my sweet Salome! are obstinacy and prejudice
to be obeyed against the understanding and the heart?
Can a father counsel his child to a crime, and would it not be
one to give your faith to this Jubal, if you could not love
him?”</p>

<p>“I have decided that already. Never will I wed Jubal.”</p>

<p>“Yet what is it that you would disobey—a cruel and fantastic
scruple of your teachers, the perverters of your law?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Must we sacrifice reason to prejudice, truth to caprice, the
law of nature and of heaven to the forgeries and follies of the
Scribes? Mine you are, and mine you shall be, my wife by a
law more sacred, more powerful, and more pure. The time
of bondage is passed. A new law, a new hope, have come to
break the chains of the Jew and enlighten the darkness of
the Gentile. You have heard that law; your generous heart
and unclouded understanding have received it, and now by
that common hope, my beloved, we are one, tho seas and
mountains should separate us—tho the malice of fortune
and the tyranny of man should forbid our union; still, in
flight, in the dungeon, in the last hour of a troubled existence,
we are one. Now, Salome, I will go, but go to seek your
father.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Assertion</div>

<p>My indignation rose to its height. I had heard my child
taught to rebel. I had heard myself pronounced the slave of
prejudice. But the open declaration that my authority was
to be to my child a law no more let loose the whole storm of
my soul. I rushed forward; Salome uttered a cry and sank
senseless upon the ground. Constantius raised her up and
bore her to a vase, from which he sprinkled water upon her
forehead.</p>

<p>“Leave her!” I exclaimed; “better for her to remain in
that insensibility, better to be dead than an apostate. Villain,
begone! it is only in scorn that a father’s vengeance suffers
you to live. Fly from this house, from this country. Go,
traitor, and let me never see you more.”</p>

<p>I tore the fainting girl from his arms. He made no resistance,
no reply. Salome recovered with a gush of tears, and
feebly pronounced his name.</p>

<p>“I am with you still, my love,” Constantius assured
her.</p>

<p>She looked up and, as if she had then first seen me, sprang
forward with a look of terror.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wrath of a Father</div>

<p>“Go,” said I, “go to your chamber, weak girl, and on
your knees, atone for your disobedience, for your abandonment
of the faith of your fathers. But no, it is impossible; you
can not have been so guilty; this Greek—this foreign bringer-in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of fables—this smooth intruder on the peace of families,
can not have so triumphed over your understanding.”</p>

<p>“I have been rash, sir,” said Constantius loftily; “I may
have been unwise, too, in my language; but I have been no
deceiver. Not for the wealth of kings—not even for the more
precious treasure of the heart I love—would I sully my lips
with a falsehood.”</p>

<p>“Begone!” cried I; “I am insulted by your presence. Go
and pervert others—hypocrite; or rather, take my contemptuous
forgiveness and repent, in sackcloth and ashes, the basest
crime of the basest mind. Come, daughter, and leave the
baffled idolater to think of his crime.”</p>

<p>I was leading her away—she hesitated, and I cast her from
me. Constantius, with his cheek burning and his eye flashing,
approached her. My taunts had at length roused him.</p>

<p>“Now, Salome,” said he, haughtily glancing on me, “injured
as I am, I disclaim an idle deference for an authority
used only to give pain. You are my betrothed; you shall
be my bride. Let us go forth and try our chance together
through the world.”</p>

<p>She was silent and wept only more violently. But with
one hand covering her face, she repelled him with the other.</p>

<p>“Then you will be the wife of Jubal?” said he.</p>

<p>“Never!” she firmly pronounced. “So help me heaven,
never!”</p>

<p>“Retire, girl,” I exclaimed, “and weep tears of blood for
your rebellion! Go, stranger—ingrate—deceiver—and never
darken my threshold more. Aye, now I see the cause of my
brave kinsman’s departure. He was circumvented. A wilier
tongue was here before him. He disdained to reveal the
daughter’s folly to the insulted father. But this shall not
avail either of you. He shall return.”</p>

<p>Salome cast an imploring glance to heaven and sank upon
her knees before me. Constantius advanced to her; but I
bounded between them—my dagger was drawn.</p>

<p>“Touch her, and you die.”</p>

<p>He smiled scornfully, and approached to raise her from
the ground.</p>

<p>“Give that wretched child up to me this moment,” I exclaimed
in fury, “or may the bitterness of a father’s curse be
on her head!”</p>

<p>He staggered back; then pressing his lips upon her forehead,
gave her to me and strode from the pavilion.</p>

<p>I flew to the house of Eleazar. I found him anxious and
agitated. Calm as his usual manner was, the late transaction
had left its traces on his demeanor and countenance. Jubal
was in the apartment, which he traversed backward and forward
in high indignation. He made no return to my salute
but by stopping short and gazing full on me with a look of
mingled anger and surprise.</p>

<p>“Jubal,” said I, “kinsman, we must be friends.” I held
out my hand, which he took with no fervent pressure. “I
am here only to explain this idle offense.”</p>

<p>“It requires no explanation,” interrupted Jubal sternly;
“I, and I alone, am to blame—if there be any one to blame
in the matter. The offer may have been hasty, or unwelcome,
or unpardonable, from one like me, still without rank in the
tribe; it may have been fit that I should be haughtily rejected
by the family of the descendant of Aaron; but,” said he,
pressing his strong hand upon his throat, as if to keep down
a burst of passion, “the subject is at an end—now and forever
at an end.”</p>

<p>He recommenced his striding through the chamber.</p>

<p>“Let us hear all, my friend,” said I; “I know that Salome
thinks highly of your spirit and of your heart. Was there any
palliation offered? Did she disclose any secret reason for a
conduct which is so opposite to her natural regard for you,
and which, she must feel, is so offensive to me? But insult
from my family, impossible!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius Accused</div>

<p>“Hear, then. I had not alighted from my horse when I
saw displeasure written in the face of every female in your
household. From the very handmaids up to their mistress,
they had, with the instinct of woman, discovered my object,
and, with the usual deliberation of the sex, had made up their
minds without hearing a syllable. Your wife received me, it
is true, with the grace that belongs to her above women, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
she was visibly cold. My kinswoman Esther absolutely
shrank from me and scorned to return a word. Salome fled.
As for the attendants, they frowned and muttered at me in all
directions, with the most candid wrath possible. In short, I
could not have fared worse had I been a Roman come to take
possession, or an Arab riding up to rifle every soul in the
house.”</p>

<p>“Ominous enough!” said Eleazar, with his grave smile.
“The opinions of the sex are irresistible. With half my
knowledge of them, Jubal, you would have turned your horse’s
head homeward at once, and given up your hopes of a bride at
least till the next day, or the next hour, or whatever may be
the usual time for the sex’s change of mind. Cheer up, kinsman;
caparison yourself in another dress, let time do its work—ride
over to Salathiel’s dwelling to-morrow and find a smile
for every frown of to-day.”</p>

<p>“But you saw Salome!” said I. “I am impatient to hear
how she could have ventured to offend. Could she dare to
refuse my brother’s request without a reason?”</p>

<p>“No; her conduct was altogether without disguise. She
first tried to laugh me out of my purpose, then argued, then
wept; and finally, told me that our alliance was impossible.”</p>

<p>“Rash girl! but she has been led into this folly by others;
yet the chief folly was my own. Aye, my eyes were dim,
where a mole would have seen. I suffered a showy, plausible
villain to remain under my roof till he has, by what arts I
know not, wiled away the duty and the understanding—nay,
I fear, the religion of my child.” I smote my breast in sorrow
and humiliation.</p>

<p>Jubal burst from the apartment and returned with his lance
in his hand, quivering with wrath.</p>

<p>“Now all is cleared,” cried he; “the true cause was the
magic of that idolater. I know the arts of paganism to bewitch
the senses of woman—the incantations, the perfumes,
the midnight fires, and images and songs. But let him come
within the throw of this javelin and then try whether all his
magic can shield him.”</p>

Advice</div>

<p>“Stop, madman! Is it with hands dipped in blood that you
are to solicit the heart of Salome? Give me that horrid
weapon; and you, Salathiel, curb your wild spirit and listen
to a brother who can have no interest but in the happiness of
both and all. If Salome, whom I loved an infant on the
knee and love to this moment, the most ingenuous and happy-hearted
being on earth, has been betrayed into a fondness for
this stranger, have we the right to force her inclinations? I
know the depth of understanding that lies under her playfulness;
can she have been deceived, and least of all by those
arts? Impossible! If she has sacrificed her obedience to the
noble form and high accomplishments of the Greek, we can
only lament her exposure to a captivation made to subdue the
heart of woman since the world began.”</p>

<p>“Jubal,” interrupted I, “give me that manly and honest
hand; Eleazar’s wisdom is too calm to understand a father or
a lover. You shall return with me, you shall be my son;
Salathiel has no other. This foolish girl will be sorry for her
follies and rejoice to receive you. The Greek is driven from
my house. And let me see who there will henceforth disobey.”
The lover’s face brightened with joy.</p>

<p>“Well, make your experiment,” said Eleazar, rising. “So
ends all councils of war in more confusion than they began.
But if I had a wife and daughters——”</p>

<p>“Of course you would manage them to perfection. So say
all who have never had either.”</p>

<p>Eleazar’s cheek colored slightly; but with his recovering
smile of benevolence he followed us to the porch, and wished
us success in our expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Forced Betrothal</div>

<p>We found the household tranquillized again. Miriam received
me with one of those radiant smiles that are a husband’s
best welcome home. She had succeeded in calming
the minds of her daughters, and—a much more difficult task—in
suppressing the wrath of the numerous female domestics
who had, as usual, constructed out of the graces of the Greek
and the beauty of Salome a little romance of their own. In
the whole course of my life I never met a female, from the
flat-nosed and ebony-colored monster of the tropics to the snow-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and sublime divinity of a Greek isle, without a touch of
romance; repulsiveness could not conceal it, age could not
extinguish it, vicissitude could not change it. I have found
it in all times and places, like a spring of fresh waters starting
up even from the flint, cheering the cheerless, softening
the insensible, renovating the withered; a secret whisper in
the ear of every woman alive, that to the last, passion might
flutter its pinions round her brow. The strong prejudices of
our nation had here given way, rebellion was but hushed, and
I was warned by many a look of the unwelcome suitor that
I brought among them.</p>

<p>But from Salome there was no remonstrance. I should
have listened to none. The consciousness of my own want
of judgment in suffering a man so calculated to attract the
eye of innocent youth to become an inmate in my house; the
vexation which I felt at the dismissal of my brother’s heir;
and last and keenest pang, the inroad made in the faith of
a daughter of Israel, combined to exasperate me beyond the
bounds of patience. I loved my child with the strongest
affection of a heart rocked by all the tides of passion; but I
could bear to look upon the pale beauty of her face—nay, in
the wrath of the hour, could have seen her borne to the grave—rather
than permit the command to be disputed by which
she was to wed in our tribe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Flight of Salome</div>

<p>To shorten a period of which I felt the full bitterness, the
marriage preparations were hurried on. Never was the ceremony
anticipated with less joy; we were all unhappy. Eleazar
remonstrated, but in vain. Jubal retracted, but I compelled
him to adhere to his proposal. Miriam was closeted perpetually
with the betrothed, and of the whole household Esther
alone walked or talked with me, and it was then only to give
me descriptions of her sister’s misery or to pursue me through
the endless mazes of argument on the hardship of being forced
to be happy. The preparations proceeded. The piece of
silver was given, the contracts were signed, the presents of
both families were made; the portion was agreed upon. It
was not customary to require the appearance of the bride until
the celebration itself, and Salome was invisible during those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
days of activity in which, however, I took the chief interest,
for nothing could be further from zeal than the conduct of the
other agents, Jubal alone excepted. He had regained the
easily recovered confidence of youth, and perhaps prided himself
on the triumph over a rival so formidable. Two or three
petitions for an interview came to me from my daughter. But
I knew their purport, and steadily determined not to hazard
the temptation of her tears.</p>

<p>The day came, and with it the guests; our dwelling was
full of banqueting. The evening arrived when the ceremony
was to be performed and the bride led home to her husband’s
house in the usual triumph. One of our customs was that a
procession of the bridegroom’s younger friends, male and
female, should be formed outside the house to wait for the
coming forth of the married pair. The ceremony was borrowed
by other nations; but in our bright climate and cloudless
nights, the profusion of lamps and torches, the burning
perfumes, glittering dresses, and fantastic joy of the dancing
and singing crowd, had unequaled liveliness and beauty. I
remained at my casement, gazing on the brilliant escort that,
as it gathered and arranged itself along the gardens, looked
like a flight of glow-worms. But no marriage summons came.
I grew impatient. My only answer was the sight of Jubal
rushing from the house and an outcry among the women.
Salome was not to be found! She had been left by herself
for a few hours, as was the custom, to arrange her thoughts
for a ceremony which we considered religious in the highest
degree. On the bridegroom’s arrival, she had disappeared!</p>

<p>The blow struck me deep. Had I driven her into the arms
of the Greek by my severity? Had I driven her out of her
senses, or out of life? Conjecture on conjecture stung me.
I reprobated my own cruelty, refused consolation, and spent
the night in alternate self-upbraidings and prayers for my unhappy
child.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Search in Vain</div>

<p>Search was indefatigably made. The fiery jealousy of
Jubal, the manly anxiety of Eleazar, the hurt feelings of our
tribe, insulted by the possibility that their chieftain’s heir
should have been scorned, and that the triumph should be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
an alien, were all embarked in the pursuit. But search was
in vain; and after days and nights of weariness, I returned to
my home, there to be met by sorrowing faces, and to feel that
every tear was forced by my own obstinacy. I shrank into
solitude. I exclaimed that the vengeance, the more than
vengeance of my crime, had struck its heaviest blow on me in
the loss of my child.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Salathiel Faces a Roman</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">In
Pursuit</div>

<p>I was in one of those fits of abstraction, revolving the
misery in which my beloved daughter might be, if indeed she
were in existence, when the door of my chamber opened softly
and one of my domestics appeared, making a signal of silence.
This was he whom I had detected in correspondence with the
Roman agent and forgiven through the entreaties of Miriam.
The man had since shown remarkable interest in the recovery
of my daughter, and thus completely reinstated himself. He
knelt before me, and with more humility than I desired, implored
my pardon for having again held intercourse with the
Roman.</p>

<p>“It was my zeal,” said he, “to gain intelligence, for I
knew that nothing passed in the provinces a secret from him.
This letter is his answer, and perhaps I shall be forgiven for
the sake of what it contains.”</p>

<p>I read it with trembling avidity. It was mysterious; described
two fugitives who had made their escape to Cæsarea, and
intimated that as they were about to fly into Asia Minor, the
pursuit must be immediate and conducted with the utmost
secrecy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Before Gessius Florus</div>

<p>I was instantly on horseback. Dreading to disturb my
family by false hopes, I ordered out my hounds, ranged the
hills in sight of my dwelling; and then turning off, struck in
the spur, and attended only by the domestic, went full speed
to Cæsarea. From the summit of Mount Carmel I looked
down upon the city and the broad Mediterranean. But my
eyes then felt no delight in the grandeur of art or nature.
The pompous structures on which Herod the Great had expended
a treasure beyond count, and which the residence of
the governor made the Roman capital of Judea, were to me
but so many dens and dungeons in which my child might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hidden. The sea showed me only the path by which she might
have been borne away, or the grave in which her wanderings
were to close.</p>

<p>By extraordinary speed I entered the gates just as the
trumpet was sounding for their close. My attendant went
forth to obtain information, and I was left pacing my chamber,
to which I had been brought in feverish suspense. I did not
suffer it long. The door opened, and a group of soldiers ordered
me to follow them. Resistance was useless. They led
me to the palace. There I was delivered from guard to guard,
through a long succession of apartments, until we reached the
door of a banqueting-room. The festivity within was high,
and if I could have then sympathized with singing and
laughter, I might have had full indulgence during the immeasurable
hour that I lingered out, a broken wretch, exhausted
by desperate effort, sick at heart, and of course eager
for the result of an interview with the Roman procurator, a
man whose name was equivalent to vice, extortion, and love
of blood throughout Judea.</p>

<p>At length the feast was at an end. I was summoned, and
for the first time saw Gessius Florus,<a name="ENanchor_25" id="ENanchor_25"></a><a href="#Endnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> a little bloated figure,
with a countenance that to the casual observer was the model
of gross good-nature, a twinkling eye, and a lip on the perpetual
laugh. His bald forehead wore a wreath of flowers,
and his tunic and the couch on which he lay breathed perfume.
The table before him was a long vista of sculptured cups,
and golden vases and candelabra.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have detained you so long,” said he, “but
this was the Emperor’s birthday, and as good subjects we
have kept it accordingly.”</p>

<p>During this speech he was engaged in contemplating the
wine-bubbles as they sparkled above the brim of a large
amethystine goblet. A pale and delicate Italian boy, sumptuously
dressed, the only one of the guests who remained, perceiving
that I was fatigued, filled a cup and presented it.</p>

<p>“Right, Septimius,” said the debauchee; “make the Jew
drink the Emperor’s health.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Procurator’s Story</div>

<p>The youth bowed gracefully before me, and again offered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
cup; but the time was not for indulgence, and I laid it on the
table.</p>

<p>“Here’s long life and glory to Nero Claudius Cæsar, our
pious, merciful, and invincible Emperor!” cried Florus, and
only when he had drunk to the bottom of the goblet, found
leisure to look upon his prisoner.</p>

<p>He either felt or affected surprise, and, turning to his young
companion, said: “By Hercules, boy, what grand fellows
those Jews make! The helmet is nothing to the turban, after
all. What magnificence of beard! No Italian chin has the
vigor to grow anything so superb; then the neck, like the
bull of Milo; and those blazing eyes! If I had but a legion
of such spearsmen——”</p>

<p>I grew impatient and said: “I stand here, procurator, in
your bonds. I demand why? I have business that requires
my instant attention and I desire to be gone.”</p>

<p>“Now have I treated you so inhospitably,” said he, laughing,
“that you expect I shall finish by shutting my doors upon
you at this time of night?” He glanced upon his tablets and
read my name. “Aye,” said he, “and after I had been so
long wishing for the honor of your company. Jew, take your
wine and sit down upon that couch, and tell me what brought
you to Cæsarea.”</p>

<p>I told him briefly the circumstances. He roared with
laughter, desired me to repeat them, and swore that “By all
the gods! it was the very best piece of pleasantry he had
heard since he set foot in Judea.” I stood up in irrepressible
indignation.</p>

<p>“What!” said he, “will you go without hearing my story in
return?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of the Rack</div>

<p>He filled his goblet again to the brim, buried his purple
visage in a vase of roses, and having inhaled the fragrance,
and chosen an easy posture, said coldly: “Jew, you have
told me a most excellent story, and it is only fair that I
should tell you one in return; not half so amusing, I admit,
but to the full as true. Jew, you are a traitor!” I started
back. “Jew,” said he, “you must in common civility
hear me out. The truth is, that your visit has been so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
anticipated and so long delayed that I can not bear to part
with you yet; you are an apostate; you encourage those
Christian dogs. Why does the man stare? You are in communication
with rebels, and I might have had the honor of
meeting you in the field, if you had not put yourself into my
hands in Cæsarea.”</p>

<p>He pronounced those words of death in the most tranquil
tone; not a muscle moved; the cup which he held brimful in
his hand never overflowed.</p>

<p>“Jew,” said he, “now be honest, and so far set an example
to your nation. Where is the money that has been gathered
for this rebellion? You are too sagacious a soldier to think
of going to war without the mainspring of the machine.”</p>

<p>I scorned to deny the intended insurrection, but “money
I had collected none.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said he, “you are now compelling me to a measure
which I do not like. Ho! guard!” A soldier presented
himself. “Desire that the rack shall be got ready.” The
man retired. “You see, Jew, this is all your own doing.
Give up the money, and I give up the rack. And the surrender
of the coin is asked merely in compassion to yourselves,
for without it you can not rebel, and the more you rebel the
more you will be beaten.”</p>

<p>“Beware, Gessius Florus,” I exclaimed; “beware! I am
your prisoner, entrapped, as I now see, by a villain, or by the
greater villain who corrupted him. You may rack me if you
will; you may insult my feelings, tear my flesh, take my life,
but for this there shall be retribution. Through Upper Galilee,
from Tiberias to the top of Libanus, this act of blood will
ring, and be answered by blood. I have kinsmen many,
countrymen myriads. A single wrench of my sinews may
lift a hundred thousand arms against your city, and leave of
yourself nothing but the remembrance, of your crimes.”</p>

<p>He bounded from his couch; the native fiend flashed out in
his countenance. I waited his attack, with my hand on the
poniard within my sash. My look probably deterred him, for
he flung himself back again, and bursting into a loud laugh,
exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">On
to Rome</div>

<p>“Bravely spoken. Septimius, we must send the Jew
to Rome, to teach our orators. Aye, I know Upper Galilee
too well not to know that rebellion is more easily raised
there than the taxes. And it was for that reason that I invited
you to come to Cæsarea. In the midst of your tribe,
capture would have cost half a legion; here a single jailer
will do the business. Ho! guard!” he called aloud.</p>

<p>I heard the screwing of the rack in the next room and
unsheathed the poniard. The blade glittered in his eyes.
Septimius came between us, and tried to turn the procurator’s
purpose.</p>

<p>“Let your guard come,” cried I, “and by the sacredness of
the Temple, one of us dies. I will not live to be tortured, or
you shall not live to see it.”</p>

<p>If the door had opened, I was prepared to dart upon him.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, after a whispered expostulation from
Septimius, “you must go and settle the matter with the Emperor.
The fact is, that I am too tender-hearted to govern
such a nation of dagger-bearers. So, to Nero! If we can
not send the Emperor money, we will at least send him men.”</p>

<p>He laughed vehemently at the conception; ordered the singing
and dancing slaves to return; called for wine, and plunged
again into his favorite cup.</p>

<p>Septimius arose, and led me into another chamber. I remonstrated
against the injustice of my seizure. He lamented
it, but said that the orders from Rome were strict, and that I
was denounced by some of the chiefs in Jerusalem as the
head of the late insurrection and the projector of a new one.
The procurator, he added, had been for some time anxious to
get me into his power without raising a disturbance among
my tribe; the treachery of my domestic had been employed to
effect this, and “now,” concluded he, “my best wish for you—a
wish prompted by motives of which you can form no conjecture—is
that you may be sent to Rome. Every day that
sees you in Cæsarea sees you in the utmost peril. At the
first rumor of insurrection, your life will be the sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“But my family! What will be their feelings? Can I not
at least acquaint them with my destination?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hoisting
of Sails</div>

<p>“It is impossible. And now, to let you into a state secret,
the Emperor has ordered that you should be sent to Rome.
Florus menaced you only to extort money. He now knows
you better, and would gladly enlist you in the Roman cause.
This I know to be hopeless. But I dread his caprice, and
shall rejoice to see the sails hoisted that are to carry you to
Rome. Farewell; your family shall have due intelligence.”</p>

<p>He was at the door of the chamber, but suddenly returned,
and pressing my hand, said again: “Farewell, and remember
that neither all Romans, nor even all Greeks, may be alike!”
He then with a graceful obeisance left the room.</p>

<p>Fatigue hung with a leaden weight upon my eyelids. I
tried vain experiments to keep myself from slumber in this
perilous vicinage. The huge silver chandelier, that threw a
blaze over the fretted roof, began to twinkle before me; the
busts and statues gradually mingled, and I was once more in
the land of visions. Home was before my eyes. I was suddenly
tossed upon the ocean.</p>

<p>I stood before Nero and was addressing him with a formal
harangue, when the whole tissue was broken up by a sullen
voice commanding me to rise. A soldier, sword in hand,
soon entered; he pointed to the door where an armed party
were seen, and informed me that I was ordered for immediate
embarkation.</p>

<p>It was scarcely past midnight; the stars were still in their
splendor; the pharos threw a long line of flame on the waters;
the city sounds were hushed, and silent as a procession to the
grave, we moved down to where the tall vessel lay rocking
with the breeze. At her side, a Nubian slave put a note into
my hand; it was from the young Roman, requesting my acceptance
of wine and fruits from the palace, and wishing me
a prosperous result to my voyage. The sails were hoisted;
the stately mole, that even in the night looked a mount of
marble, was cleared; the libation was poured to the Tritons
for our speedy passage, and the blazing pharos was rapidly
seen but as a twinkling star.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>On Board a Trireme</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Captain of
the Trireme</div>

<p>Our trireme flew before the wind. By daybreak the coast
was only a pale line along the waters; but Carmel still towered
proudly eminent, and with its top alternately clouded and
glittering in the sun might have been taken for a gigantic
beacon throwing up alternate smoke and flame. With what
eyes did I continue to look, until the mighty hill, too, sank in
the waters! But thought still lingered on the shore. I saw,
with a keenness more than of the eye, the family circle;
through many an hour of gazing on the waters, I was all but
standing in the midst of those walls which I might never more
see; listening to the uncomplaining sighs of Miriam, the
impassioned remonstrances of my sole remaining child, and
busied in the still harder task of finding out some defense
against the self-accusation that laid the charge of rashness and
cruelty heavy upon my soul.</p>

<p>But the scene round me was the very reverse of moody
meditation. The captain was a thorough Italian trierarch,
ostentatious, gay, given to superstition, and occasionally a
little of a free thinker. His ship was to him child, wife,
and world; and at every maneuver he claimed from us such
tribute as a father might for the virtues of his favorite offspring;
perpetual luck was in everything that she did; she
knew every headland from Cyprus to Ostia; a pilot was a
mere supernumerary; she could run the whole course without
the helm, if she pleased. She beat the <i>Liburnian</i> for speed;
the <i>Cypriot</i> for comfort; the <i>Sicilian</i> for safety; and every
other vessel on the seas for every other quality. All he
asked was to live in her, while he lived at all, and to go down
in her when the Fates were at last to cut his thread, as they
did those of all captains, whether on sea or land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Motley
Crowd</div>

<p>The panegyric of the good ship <i>Ganymede</i> was in some degree
merited; she carried us on boldly. For a sea in which
the winds are constant when they come, but in which the calms
are as constant as the winds, nothing could have been more
perfectly adapted than the ancient galley. If the gale arose,
the ship shot along like the eagle that bore her Trojan namesake—light,
strong, with her white sails full of the breeze,
and cleaving the surge with the rapidity of an arrow. If the
wind fell we floated in a pavilion, screened from the sun, refreshed
with perfumes burning on poop, brow, and masts,
surrounded with gilding and, the carvings and paintings of the
Greek artists, drinking delicious wines, listening to song and
story, and in all this enjoyment gliding insensibly along on a
lake of absolute sapphire encircled and varied by the most
picturesque and lovely islands in the world.</p>

<p>The <i>Ganymede</i> had been under especial orders from Rome for
my transmission; but the captain felt too much respect for the
procurator not to trespass on the letter of the law so far as to
fill up the vacancies of his hold with merchandise, in which
Florus drove a steady contraband trade. Having done so much
to gratify the governor’s distinguishing propensity, he next provided
for his own; and loaded his gallant vessel mercilessly
with passengers, as much prohibited as his merchandise.
While we were yet in sight of land, I walked a lonely deck;
but when the salutary fear of the galleys on the station was
passed, every corner of the <i>Ganymede</i> let loose a living cargo.</p>

<p>For the Jewish chieftain going from Florus on a mission to
the Emperor, as the captain conceived me and my purpose to
be, a separate portion of the deck was kept sacred. But I
mingled from time to time with the crowd, and thus contrived
to preserve at once my respect and my popularity. Never
was there a more miscellaneous collection. We transported
into Europe a Chaldee sorcerer, an Indian gymnosophist, an
Arab teacher of astrology, a Magian from Persepolis, and a
Platonist from Alexandria. Such were our contributions to
Oriental science.</p>

<p>We had, besides, a dealer in sleight-of-hand from Damascus;
an Egyptian with tame monkeys and a model of a pyramid; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Syrian serpent-teacher; an Idumean maker of amulets against
storm and calm, thirst and hunger, and every other disturbance
and distress of life; an Armenian discoverer of the stone by
which gold-mines were to be found; a Byzantine inventor of
the true Oriental pearls; a dealer from the Caspian in gums
superseding all that Arabia ever wept; an Epicurean philosopher
who professed indolence, and who, to do him justice, was
a striking example of his doctrine; and a Stoic who, having
gone his rounds of the Roman garrisons as a teacher of dancing,
a curer of wines, and a flute-player, had now risen into
the easier vocation of a philosopher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Differences of
Opinion</div>

<p>Of course, among these professors, the discoverer of gold was
the most moneyless; the maker of amulets against misfortune
the most miserable; and the Stoic the most impatient. The
Epicurean alone adhered to the spirit of his profession.</p>

<p>But the unstable elements round us were a severe trial for
any human philosophy but that of a thorough optimist. Wind
and water, the two most imperious of all things, were our
masters; and a calm, a breeze, or even a billow, often tried
our reasoners too roughly for the honor of tempers so saturated
with wisdom. On those occasions the Platonist defended the
antiquity of Egypt with double pertinacity; the Chaldee derided
its novelty by the addition of a hundred thousand years
to his chronology of Babylon; the Indian with increased scorn,
wrinkling his brown visage, told them that both Babylon and
Egypt were baubles of yesterday compared with the million
years of India.</p>

<p>The dagger would have silenced many a discussion on
the chief good, the origin of benevolence, and the beauty
of virtue, but for the voice of the captain, which like thunder
cleared the air. He, I will allow, was the truest philosopher
of us all. The trierarch was an unconscious optimist;
nothing could touch him in the shape of misfortune, for to
him it had no existence. If the storm rose, “we should
get the more rapidly into port”; if the calm came to fix us
scorching on the face of the waters, “nothing could be safer.”
If our provisions fell short, “abstemiousness now and then
was worth a generation of doctors.” If the sun burned above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
us with the fire of a ball of red-hot iron, “it was the test of
fair weather”; if the sky was a mass of vapor, “we escaped
being roasted alive.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Philosophy
of a Captain</div>

<p>His maxims on higher subjects were equally consoling.
“If man had to struggle through life, struggle was the nursing-mother
of greatness; if he were opulent, he had gained
the end without the trouble. If he had disease, he learned
patience, essential for sailor, soldier, and philosopher alike;
if he enjoyed health, who could doubt the blessing? If he
lived long, he had time for pleasure; if he died early, he
escaped the chances of the tables’ turning.” The optimist
applied his principle to me, by gravely informing me that
“though it depended on the Emperor’s state of digestion
whether I should or should not carry back my head from his
presence, yet if I lived, I should see the games of the Circus,
and if I did not, I should in all probability care but little
about the matter.”</p>

<p>Nothing in the variety of later Europe gives me a parallel
to the distinctions of rank and profession, style of subsistence,
and physiognomy of society in the ancient world. Human
nature was classed in every kingdom, province, and city almost
as rigidly as the different races of mankind. The divisions
of the slave, the freedman, the citizen, the artist, the
priest, the man of literature, and the man of public life were
cut with a plowshare whose furrows were never filled up.
Life had the curious mixture of costume, the palpable diversity
of purpose, and the studied intricacy of a drama.</p>

<p>Our voyage was rapid, but even a lingering transit would
have been cheered by the innumerable objects of beauty and
memory which rise on every side in the passage through a
Grecian sea. The islands were then untouched by the spoiler;
the opulence of Rome had been added to Attic taste; and
temples, theaters, and palaces, starting from groves, or studding
the sides of the stately hills, and reflected in the mirror
of bays, smooth and bright as polished steel, held the eye a
continual captive. On the sea, nights of vessels, steering in
all directions, glittering with the emblems of their nations,
the colored pennants, the painted prows, and gilded images of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
their protecting deities, covered the horizon with life. We
had reached the southern cape of Greece, and were, with a
boldness unusual to ancient navigation, stretching across in a
starless night for the coast of Italy, when we caught a sound
of distant music that recalled the poetic dreams of nymphs and
tritons. The sound swelled and sank on the wind, as if it
came from the depths of the sea or the bosom of the clouds.
As we parted from the land, it swelled higher until it filled
the midnight with pompous harmony. To sleep was profanation,
and we all gathered on the deck, exhausting nature and
art in conjectures of the cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Imperial
Fleet</div>

<p>The harmony approached and receded at intervals, grew
in volume and richness, then stole away in wild murmurs, to
revive with still more luxuriant sweetness. Night passed in
delight and conjecture. Morning alone brought the solution.</p>

<p>Full in the blaze of sunrise steered the imperial fleet, returning
in triumph from the Olympic games, with the Emperor
on board. We had unconsciously approached it during the
darkness.</p>

<p>The whole scene wore the aspect of a vision summoned by
the hand of an enchanter. The sea was covered with the fleet
in order of battle. Some of the galleys were of vast size, and
all were gleaming with gold and decorations; silken sails,
garlands on the masts, trophies hung over the sides, and embroidered
streamers of every shape and hue, met the morning
light. We passed the wing of the fleet, close enough to see
the sacrificial fires on the poop of the imperial quinquereme.
A crowd in purple and military habits was standing round a
throne, above which proudly waved the scarlet flag of
command. A figure advanced; all foreheads were bowed,
acclamations rent the air, the trumpets of the fleet flourished,
and the lofty harmonies that had charmed us in the night
again swelled upon the wind and followed us, long after the
whole floating splendor had dissolved into the distant blue.</p>

<p>At length the headlands of the noble bay of Tarentum rose
above the horizon. While we were running with the speed
of a lapwing, the captain, to our surprise, shortened sail. I
soon discovered that no philosophy was perfect; that even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
optimist thought that daylight might be worse than useless,
and that a blot had been left on creation in the shape of a
custom-house officer.</p>

<p>Night fell at last; the moon, to which our captain had taken
a sudden aversion, was as cloudy as he could desire, and we
rushed in between the glimmering watch-towers on the Iapygian
and Lacinian promontories. The glow of light along the
waters soon pointed out where the luxurious citizens of Tarentum
were enjoying the banquet in their barges and villas.
Next came the hum of the great city, whose popular boast
was, like that of later times, that it had more festivals than
days in the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Lands</div>

<p>But the trierarch’s often-told delight at finding himself free
to rove among the indulgences of his favorite shore had lost
its poignancy; and with a firmness which set the Stoic in a
rage, the Epicurean in a state of rebellion, and the whole tribe
of our sages in a temper of mere mortal remonstrance, he resisted
alike the remonstrance and the allurement, and sullenly
cast anchor in the center of the bay.</p>

<p>It was not until song and feast had died, and all was hushed,
that he stole with the slightest possible noise to the back of
the mole, and sending us below, disburdened his conscience
and the hold of the good ship <i>Ganymede</i>. I had no time to
give to the glories of Tarentum. Nero’s approach hurried my
departure. The centurion who had me in charge trembled at
the idea of delay, and we rode through the midst of three
hundred thousand sleepers in streets of marble and ranks of
statues, as silently and swiftly as if we had been the ghosts
of their ancestors.</p>

<p>When the day broke we found ourselves among the Lucanian
hills, then no desert, but crowded with population and bright
with the memorials of Italian opulence and taste. From the
inn where we halted to change horses, the Tarentine gulf
spread broad and bold before the eye.</p>

<p>The city of luxury and of power, once the ruler of Southern
Italy, and mistress of the seas that sent out armies and fleets,
worthy to contest the supremacy with Pyrrhus and the Carthaginian,
was, from this spot, sunk like all the works of man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
into littleness. But the gulf, like all the works of nature,
grew in grandeur. Its circular shore edged with thirteen
cities, the deep azure of its smooth waters inlaid with the
flashes of sunrise, and traversed by fleets, diminished to toys,
reminded me of one of the magnificent Roman shields, with
its center of sanguine steel, the silver incrustation of the rim,
and the storied sculpture. We passed at full speed through
the Lucanian and Samnian provinces, fine sweeps of cultivated
country, interspersed with the hunting-grounds of the great
patricians; forests that had not felt the ax for centuries, and
hills and valleys sheeted with the vine and rose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In
Rome</div>

<p>But on reaching the border of Latium, I was already in
Rome; I traveled a day’s journey among streets and in the
midst of a crowded and hurrying population. The whole was
one huge suburb with occasional glimpses of a central mount,
crowned with glittering and gilded structures.</p>

<p>“There!” said the centurion, with somewhat of religious
reverence, “behold the eternal Capitol!”</p>

<p>I entered Rome at night, passing through an endless number
of narrow and intricate streets where hovels, the very abode
of want, were mingled with palaces blazing with lights and
echoing with festivity. The centurion’s house was at length
reached. He showed me to an apartment, and left me,
saying, “that I must prepare to be brought before the
Emperor immediately on his arrival.”</p>

<p>I am now, thought I, in the heart of the heart of the world;
in the midst of that place of power from which the destiny
of nations issues; in the great treasure-house to which men
come from the ends of the earth for knowledge, for justice,
for wealth, honor, thrones! And what am I?—a solitary slave!</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Burning of Rome</i></span></h3>

<p>With the original mixture of Ionian and northern blood in
his veins, the character of the Roman was at once tasteful
and barbarian. Like the Asiatic, delighting in luxury, like
the Tatar, delighting in gore, he turned the elegance of the
Greek games into the combat of gladiators. He was a voluptuary,
but the gravest of all voluptuaries. Of all nations
the Roman bore the strongest resemblance to that people of
conquerors who at length swept its name from Byzantium;
superb, but slavish; fierce, but sensual; brave as the lion,
but base in its appetites as the jackal; a people made for the
possession of empire and for its corruption.<a name="ENanchor_26" id="ENanchor_26"></a><a href="#Endnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Of all men he had the least resemblance to his successor.
Haughty, sagacious, and solemn, tho ravening for rapine,
and merciless in his revenge, he bequeathed nothing to that
miscellany of mankind which has followed him, but his passion
for shows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman
Pageantry</div>

<p>Rome was all shows. Its innumerable public events were
all thrown into the shape of pageantry. Its worship, elections,
the departure and return of governors and consuls, every
operation of public life, was modeled into a pomp, and in the
boundless extent of the empire those operations were crowding
on one another every day. The multitude that can still be
set in motion by a wooden saint was then summoned by the
stirring ceremonial of empire, the actual sovereignty of the
globe. What must have been the strong excitement, the perpetual
concourse, the living and various activity of a city from
which flowed the stream of power through the world, to return
to it loaded with all that the opulence, skill, and splendor
of the world could give.</p>

<p>Triumphs to whose grandeur and singularity the pomps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
later days are but as the attempts of paupers and children;
rites on which the very existence of the state was to depend;
the levy and march of armies which were to carry fate to the
remotest corners of the earth; the kings of the East and West
coming to solicit diadems or to deprecate the irresistible wrath
of Rome; vast theaters; public games that tasked the whole
fertility of Roman talent, and the most prodigal lavishness of
imperial luxury, were the movers that among the four millions
of Rome made life a hurricane.</p>

<p>I saw it in its full and grand commotion; I saw it in its
desperate agony; I saw it in its frivolous revival, and I shall
see it in an hour, wilder, weaker, and more terrible than all.
I remained under the charge of the centurion. No man could
be better fitted for a state jailer. Civility sat on his lips, but
caution the most profound sat beside her. He professed to
have the deepest dependence on my honor, yet he never let
me move beyond his eye. But I had no desire to escape.
The crisis must come, and I was as well inclined to meet it
then as to have it lingering over me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summoned
Before the
Emperor</div>

<p>Intelligence in a few days arrived from Brundusium of the
Emperor’s landing, and of his intention to remain at Antium
until his triumphal entry should be prepared. My fate now
hung in the balance. I was ordered to attend the imperial
presence. At the vestibule of the Antian palace my careful
centurion deposited me in the hands of a senator.</p>

<p>As I followed him through the halls, a young female richly
attired, and of the most beautiful face and form, crossed us,
light and graceful as a dancing nymph. The senator bowed
profoundly. She beckoned to him and they exchanged a few
words. I was probably the subject, for her countenance,
sparkling with the animation of youth and loveliness, grew
pale at once; she clasped both her hands upon her eyes and
rushed into an inner chamber. She knew Nero well; and
dearly she was yet to pay for her knowledge.</p>

<p>The senator, to my inquiring glance, answered in a whisper,
“The Empress Poppæa.”</p>

<p>A few steps onward and I stood in the presence of the most
formidable being on earth. Yet whatever might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
my natural agitation at the time, I could scarcely restrain a
smile at the first sight of Nero.<a name="ENanchor_27" id="ENanchor_27"></a><a href="#Endnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nero
the Tyrant</div>

<p>I saw a pale, undersized, light-haired young man, sitting before
a table with a lyre on it, and a parrot’s cage, to whose
inmate he was teaching Greek with great assiduity. But for
the regal furniture of the cabinet I should have supposed myself
led by mistake into an interview with some struggling
poet. He shot round one quick glance on the opening of the
door, and then proceeded to give lessons to his bird. I had
leisure to gaze on the tyrant and parricide.</p>

<p>Physiognomy is a true science. The man of profound
thought, the man of active ability, and, above all, the man of
genius has his character stamped on his countenance by nature;
the man of violent passions and the voluptuary have it stamped
by habit. But the science has its limits: it has no stamp for
mere cruelty. The features of the human monster before me
were mild and almost handsome; a heavy eye and a figure
tending to fulness gave the impression of a quiet mind, and
but for an occasional restlessness of brow and a brief glance
from under it, in which the leaden eye darted suspicion, I
should have pronounced Nero one of the most indolently
harmless of mankind.</p>

<p>He now remanded his pupil to its perch, took up the lyre,
and throwing a not unskilful hand over the strings in the
intervals of his performance, languidly addressed a broken
sentence to me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Escape</div>

<p>“You have come, I understand, from Judea; they tell me
that you have been, or are to be, a general of the insurrection.
You must be put to death; your countrymen give me
a great deal of trouble, and I always regret to be troubled
with them. But to send you back would be only an encouragement
to them, and to keep you here among strangers would
be only a cruelty to you. I am charged with cruelty; you
see the charge is not true. I am lampooned every day;
I know the scribblers, but they must lampoon or starve and I
leave them to do both. Have you brought any news from
Judea? They have not had a true prince there since the first
Herod and he was quite a Greek, a cut-throat and a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
taste. He understood the arts. I sent for you to see what
sort of animal a Jewish rebel was. Your dress is handsome,
but too light for our winters. You can not die before sunset,
as until then I am engaged with my music-master. We all
must die when our time comes. Farewell—till sunset may
Jupiter protect you!”</p>

<p>I retired to execution, and before the door closed heard
this accomplished disposer of life and death preluding upon
his lyre with increased energy. I was conducted to a turret
until the period in which the Emperor’s engagement with his
music-master should leave him at leisure to see me die!</p>

<p>Yet there was kindness even under the roof of Nero, and a
liberal hand had covered the table in my cell. The hours
passed heavily along, but they passed; and I was watching
the last rays of my last sun when I suddenly perceived a cloud
rise in the direction of Rome. It grew broader, deeper, darker
as I gazed; its center was suddenly tinged with red; the tinge
spread; the whole mass of cloud became crimson; the sun
went down, and another sun seemed to have risen in its stead.
I heard the clattering of horses’ feet in the courtyards below;
trumpets sounded; there was evident confusion in the palace;
the troops hurried under arms, and I saw a squadron of cavalry
set off at full speed.</p>

<p>As I was gazing on the spectacle before me, which perpetually
became more menacing, the door of my cell slowly opened,
and a masked figure stood upon the threshold. I had made
up my mind, and demanding if he were the executioner, told
him “I was ready.” The figure paused, listened to the sounds
below, and after looking for a while on the troops in the
courtyard, signified by signs that I had a chance of saving
my life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rome Aflame</div>

<p>The love of existence rushed back upon me; I eagerly inquired
what was to be done. He drew from under his cloak
the dress of a Roman slave, which I put on, and noiselessly
followed his steps through a long succession of small and
strangely intricate passages. We found no difficulty from
guards or domestics. The whole palace was in a state of extraordinary
alarm. Every human being was packing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
something or other; rich vases, myrrhine cups, gold services,
were lying in heaps on the floors; books, costly dresses, instruments
of music, all the appendages of luxury, were flung
loose in every direction—signs of the sudden breaking up of
the court. I might have plundered the value of a province
with impunity. Still we wound our hurried way. In passing
along one of the corridors, the voice of sorrow struck the
ear; my mysterious guide hesitated; I glanced through the
slab of crystal that showed the chamber within.</p>

<p>It was the one in which I had seen the Emperor, but his
place was now filled by the form of youth and beauty which
had crossed me on my arrival. She was weeping bitterly,<a name="ENanchor_28" id="ENanchor_28"></a><a href="#Endnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and reading with passionate indignation a long list of names,
probably one of those rolls in which Nero registered his intended
victims, and which in the haste of departure he had
left open. A second glance saw her tear the paper into a
thousand fragments and scatter them in the fountain that
gushed upon the floor. I left this lovely and unhappy creature,
this dove in the vulture’s talons, with almost a pang.
A few steps more brought us into the open air, but among
bowers that covered our path with darkness. At the extremity
of the gardens my guide struck with his dagger upon a
door; it was opened; we found horses outside; he sprang on
one; I sprang on its fellow, and palace, guards, and death
were left far behind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Progress of Destruction</div>

<p>He galloped so furiously that I found it impossible to
speak, and it was not till we had reached an eminence a few
miles from Rome, where we breathed our horses, that I could
ask to whom I had been indebted for my escape. But I could
not extract a word from him. He made signs of silence and
pointed with wild anxiety to the scene that spread below. It
was of a grandeur and terror indescribable. Rome was an
ocean of flame! Height and depth were covered with red
surges that rolled before the blast like an endless tide. The
flames burst up the sides of the hills, which they turned into
instant volcanoes, exploding volumes of smoke and fire; then
plunged into the depths in a hundred glowing cataracts; then
climbed and consumed again. The distant sound of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
city in her convulsion went to the soul. The air was filled
with the steady roar of the advancing blaze, the crash of falling
houses, and the hideous outcry of the myriads flying
through the streets, or surrounded and perishing in the conflagration.</p>

<p>Hostile to Rome as I was, I could not restrain the
exclamation: “There goes the fruit of conquest, the glory
of ages, the purchase of the blood of millions! Was vanity
made for man?” My guide continued looking forward with
intense earnestness, as if he were perplexed by what avenue
to enter the burning city. I demanded who he was, and
whither he would lead me. He returned no answer. A long
spire of flame that shot up from a hitherto-untouched quarter
engrossed all his senses. He struck in the spur, and making
a wild gesture to me to follow, darted down the hill.</p>

<p>I pursued; we found the Appian choked with wagons, baggage
of every kind, and terrified crowds hurrying into the
open country. To force a way through them was impossible.
All was clamor, violent struggle, and helpless death. Men
and women of the highest rank were hurrying on foot, or
trampled by the rabble that had then lost all respect of condition.
One dense mass of miserable life, irresistible from its
weight, crushed by the narrow streets and scorched by the
flames over their heads, continued to roll through the gates
like an endless stream of black lava.</p>

<p>We now turned back and attempted an entrance through
the gardens of some of the villas that skirted the city wall
near the Palatine. All were deserted, and after some dangerous
bounds over the burning ruins we found ourselves in the
streets. The fire had originally broken out on the Palatine,
and hot smoke that wrapped and half-blinded us hung thick
as night upon the wrecks of pavilions and palaces; but the
dexterity and knowledge of my inexplicable guide carried us
on. It was in vain that I insisted upon knowing the purpose
of this terrible traverse. He pressed his hand on his heart in
reassurance of his fidelity, and still spurred on.</p>

<p>We now passed under the shade of an immense range of
lofty buildings, whose gloomy and solid strength seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
bid defiance to chance and time. A sudden scream appalled
me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In
the Arena</div>

<p>A ring of fire swept round its summit; burning cordage,
sheets of canvas, and a shower of all things combustible flew
into the air above our heads. An uproar followed, unlike all
that I had ever heard, a hideous mixture of howls, shrieks,
and groans. The flames rolled down the narrow street before
us and made the passage next to impossible. While we hesitated,
a huge fragment of the building heaved, as if in an
earthquake, and fortunately for us fell inward. The whole
scene of terror was then open.</p>

<p>The great amphitheater of Statilius Taurus had caught fire;
the stage with its inflammable furniture was blazing below.
The flames were wheeling up, circle above circle, through the
seventy thousand seats that rose from the ground to the roof.
I stood in unspeakable awe and wonder on the side of this
colossal cavern, this mighty temple of the city of fire. At
length a descending blast cleared away the smoke that covered
the arena. The cause of those horrid cries was now visible.
The wild beasts kept for the games had broken from their dens.
Maddened by affright and pain, lions, tigers, panthers, wolves,
whole herds of the monsters of India and Africa, were enclosed
in an impassable barrier of fire. They bounded, they fought,
they screamed, they tore; they ran howling round and round
the circle; they made desperate leaps upward through the
blaze; when flung back, they fell, only to fasten their fangs
in each other, and with their parching jaws bathed in blood,
die raging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mamartine, the Roman Prison</div>

<p>I looked anxiously to see whether any human being was
involved in this fearful catastrophe; but to my relief, I
could see none. The keepers and attendants had obviously
escaped. As I expressed my gladness I was startled by
a loud cry from my guide, the first sound that I had heard
him utter. He pointed to the opposite side of the amphitheater.
There indeed sat an object of melancholy interest—a
man who had either been unable to escape or had determined
to die. Escape was now impossible. He sat in desperate
calmness on his funeral pile. He was a gigantic Ethiopian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
slave, entirely naked. He had chosen his place, as if in
mockery, on the imperial throne; the fire was above him and
around him, and under this tremendous canopy he gazed without
the movement of a muscle on the combat of the wild
beasts below, a solitary sovereign, with the whole tremendous
game played for himself, and inaccessible to the power of man.</p>

<p>I was forced away from this absorbing spectacle, and we
once more threaded the long and intricate streets of Rome.
As we approached the end of one of those bewildering passages,
scarcely wide enough for us to ride abreast, I was startled
by the sudden illumination of the sky immediately above, and,
rendered cautious by the experience of our hazards, called to
my companion to return. He pointed behind me and showed
the fire breaking out in the houses by which we had just
galloped. I followed on. A crowd that poured from the adjoining
streets cut off our retreat. Hundreds rapidly mounted
on the houses in front, in the hope by throwing them down
to check the conflagration. The obstacle once removed, we
saw the source of the light—spectacle of horror! The great
prison of Rome, the Mamartine, was on fire.</p>

<p>Never can I forget the sights and sounds—the dismay—the
hopeless agony—the fury and frenzy that then overwhelmed
all hearts. The jailers had been forced to fly before they
could loose the fetters or open the cells of the prisoners. We
saw those gaunt and wo-begone wretches crowding to their
casements, and imploring impossible help; clinging to the
heated bars; toiling with their impotent grasp to tear out the
massive stones; some hopelessly wringing their hands; some
calling on the terrified spectators, by every name of humanity,
to save them; some venting their despair in execrations and
blasphemies that made the blood run cold; others, after many
a wild effort to break loose, dashing their heads against the
walls or stabbing themselves. The people gave them outcry
for outcry, but the flame forbade approach. Before I could
extricate myself from the multitude, a whirl of fiery ashes
shot upward from the falling roof; the walls burst into a
thousand fragments, and the huge prison, with all its miserable
inmates, was a heap of embers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Through
Increasing
Misery</div>

<p>Exhausted as I was by this endless fatigue and yet more by
the melancholy sights that surrounded every step, no fatigue
seemed to be felt by the singular being who governed my
movements. He sprang through the burning ruins; he
plunged into the sulfurous smoke; he never lost the direction
that he had first taken; and tho baffled and forced to turn
back a hundred times, he again rushed on his track with the
directness of an arrow. For me to make my way back to the
gates would be even more difficult than to push forward.
My ultimate safety might be in following, and I followed.
To stand still and to move seemed equally perilous.</p>

<p>The streets, even with the improvements of Augustus, were
still scarcely wider than the breadth of the little Volscian carts
that crowded them. They were crooked, long, and obstructed
by every impediment of a city built in haste after the burning
by the Gauls, and with no other plan than the caprice of
its hurried tenantry. The houses were of immense height,
chiefly wood, many roofed with thatch, and all covered or
cemented with pitch. The true surprise is that it had not
been burned once a year from the time of its building. Nero,
that hereditary concentration of vice, of whose ancestor’s yellow
beard the Roman orator said, “No wonder that his beard
was brass, when his mouth was iron and his heart lead,” the
parricide and the poisoner, might plausibly exonerate himself
of an act which might have been the deed of a drunken
mendicant in any of the fifty thousand hovels of this gigantic
aggregate of everything that could turn to flame.</p>

<p>We passed along through all the horrid varieties of misery,
guilt, and riot that could find their place in a great public
calamity; groups gazing in wo on the wreck of their fortunes
in vapor and fire; groups plundering in the midst of the flame;
crowds of rioters, escaped felons, and murderers, exulting in
the public ruin, and dancing and drinking with Bacchanalian
uproar; gangs of robbers stabbing the fugitives, to strip them;
revenge, avarice, despair, profligacy, let loose naked; undisguised
demons, to swell the wretchedness of this tremendous
infliction upon a blood-covered empire.</p>

<p>Still we spurred on, but our jaded horses at length sank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
under us; and leaving them to find their way into the fields,
we struggled forward on foot. The air had hitherto been
calm, but now gusts began to rise, thunder growled, and the
signs of tempest increased. We had gained an untouched
quarter of the city, and had pushed our weary passage up to
the gates of a large patrician palace, when we were startled by
a broad sheet of flame rushing through the sky. The storm
had come in its rage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Palace
Aflame</div>

<p>The range of public magazines of wood, cordage, tar, and
oil, in the valley between the Cœlian and Palatine hills, had
at length been involved in the conflagration. All that we had
seen before was darkness to the fierce splendor of this burning.
The tempest tore off the roofs and swept them like
floating islands of fire through the sky. The most distant
quarters on which they fell were instantly wrapped in flame.
One broad mass, whirling from an immense height, broke
upon the palace before us. A cry of terror was heard within.
The gates were flung open, and a crowd of domestics and persons
of both sexes, attired for a banquet, poured into the
streets. The palace was wrapped in flame.</p>

<p>My guide then for the first time lost his self-possession. He
staggered toward me with the appearance of a man who had received
a spear-head in his bosom. I caught him before he fell,
but his head sank, his knees bent under him, and his white
lips quivered with unintelligible sounds. I could distinguish
only the words—“Gone, gone forever!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Finds Salome</div>

<p>The flames had already seized upon the principal floors of
the palace, and the volumes of smoke that poured through
every window and entrance rendered the attempt to save those
still within a work of extreme hazard. But ladders were
rapidly placed, ropes were flung, and the activity of the attendants
and retainers was boldly exerted, until all were presumed
to have been saved and the building was left to burn.
My overwhelmed guide was lying on the ground when a sudden
scream was heard, and a figure in the robes and with the
rosy crown of a banquet—strange contrast to her fearful
situation—was seen flying from window to window in the upper
part of the mansion. It was supposed that she had fainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in the first terror and been forgotten. The height, the fierceness
of the flame, which now completely mastered resistance,
the volumes of smoke that suffocated every man who approached,
made the chance of saving this unfortunate being
utterly desperate in the opinion of the multitude.</p>

<p>I shuddered at the horrors of this desertion. I looked
round at my companion; he was kneeling in helpless agony,
with his hands lifted up to heaven. Another scream, wilder
than ever, pierced my senses. I seized an ax from one of
the domestics, caught a ladder from another, and in a paroxysm
of hope, fear, and pity scaled the burning wall. A shout
from below followed me.</p>

<p>I entered at the first window that I could reach. All before
me was cloud. I rushed on, struggled, stumbled over
furniture and fragments of all kinds; fell, rose again, found
myself trampling upon precious things, plate and crystal;
and still, ax in hand, forced my way. I at length reached
the apartment where I had seen the figure. It had vanished!</p>

<p>A strange superstition of childhood, a thought that I might
have been lured by some spirit of evil into this place of ruin,
suddenly came over me. I stopped to gather my faculties.
I leaned against one of the pillars—it was hot; the floor shook
and cracked under my tread; the walls heaved, the flame
hissed below, while overhead roared the whirlwind and burst
the thunder-peal.</p>

<p>My brain was fevered by agitation and fatigue. The golden
lamps still burning; the long tables disordered, yet glittering
with the ornaments of patrician luxury; the Tyrian couches;
the scarlet canopy that covered the whole range of the tables,
and gave the hall the aspect of an imperial pavilion, partially
torn down in the confusion of the flight, all assumed to me a
horrid and bewildering splendor. The smoke was already
rising through the crevices of the floor; a huge volume of yellow
vapor slowly wreathed and arched round the chair at the head
of the banquet-table. I could have imaged a fearful lord of
the feast under that cloudy veil. Everything round me was
marked with preternatural fear, magnificence, and ruin.</p>

<p>A low groan broke my reverie. I heard the broken words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pursued by
Fire</div>

<p>“Oh, bitter fruit of disobedience! Oh, my father! oh,
my mother! shall I never see you again? For one crime I am
doomed. Eternal mercy, let my crime be washed away! Let
my spirit ascend pure! Farewell, mother, sister, father, husband!”</p>

<p>With the last word I heard a fall, as if the spirit had left
the body.</p>

<p>I sprang toward the sound—I met but the solid wall.</p>

<p>“Horrible illusion!” I cried. “Am I mad, or the victim of
the powers of darkness?”</p>

<p>I tore away the hangings—a door was before me. I burst
it through with a blow of the ax, and saw stretched on the
floor, and insensible—Salome!</p>

<p>I caught my child in my arms; I bathed her forehead with
my tears; I besought her to look up, to give some sign of life,
to hear the full forgiveness of my breaking heart. She looked
not, answered not, breathed not. To make a last effort for
her life, I carried her into the banquet-room. But the fire
had forced its way there; the storm had carried the flame
through the long galleries, and spires of lurid light already
darting through the doors, gave fearful evidence that the last
stone of the palace must soon go down.</p>

<p>I bore my unhappy daughter toward the window, but the
height was deadly; no gesture could be seen through the piles
of smoke; the help of man was in vain. To my increased
misery, the current of air revived Salome at the instant when
I hoped that by insensibility she would escape the final pang.
She breathed, stood and opening her eyes, fixed on me the
vacant stare of one scarcely roused from sleep. Still clasped
in my arms she gazed again, but my wild face, covered with
dust, my half-burned hair, the ax gleaming in my hand, terrified
her; she uttered a scream and darted away from me,
headlong into the center of the burning. I rushed after her,
calling on her name. A column of fire shot up between us;
I felt the floor sink; all was then suffocation—I struggled and
fell.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Death of a Martyr</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Return to
Consciousness</div>

<p>I awoke with a sensation of pain in every limb. A female
voice was singing a faint song near me. But the past was
like a dream. I involuntarily looked down for the gulf on
which I had trod; I looked upward for the burning rafters.
I saw nothing but an earthen floor and a low roof hung with
dried grapes and herbs. I uttered a cry. The singer approached
me. There was nothing in her aspect to nurture a
diseased imagination; she was an old and emaciated creature
who yet rejoiced in my restoration. She in turn called her
husband, a venerable Jew, whose first act was to offer thanksgiving
to the God of Israel for the safety of a chief of His
nation. But to my inquiries for the fate of my child, he
could give no answer; he had discovered me among the ruins
of the palace of the Æmilii, to which he, with many of his
countrymen, had been attracted, with the object of collecting
whatever remnants of furniture might be left by the flames.
I had fallen by the edge of a fountain which extinguished the
fire in its vicinage, and I was found breathing. During three
days I had lain insensible. The Jew now went out and brought
back with him some of the elders of our people, who, notwithstanding
the decree of the Emperor Claudius, had remained
in Rome, tho in increased privacy. I was carried to their
house of assemblage, concealed among groves and vineyards
beyond the gates, and attended to with a care which might
cure all things but the wounds of the mind. On the great
object of my solicitude, the fate of my Salome, I could obtain
no relief. I wandered over the site of the palace; it was now
a mass of ashes and charcoal; its ruins had been probed by
hundreds; but search for even a trace of what would have
been to me dearer than a mountain of gold, was in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cry for
Revenge</div>

<p>The conflagration continued for six days, and every day of
the number gave birth to some monstrous report of its origin.
Of the fourteen districts of Rome, but four remained. Thousands
had lost their lives, tens of thousands were utterly undone;
the whole empire shook under the blow. Then came
the still deeper horror.</p>

<p>Fear makes the individual feeble, but it makes the multitude
ferocious. A universal cry arose for revenge. Great
public misfortunes give the opportunity that the passions of
men and sects love, and the fiercest crimes of selfishness are
justified under the name of retribution.</p>

<p>But the full calamity burst on the Christians, then too new
to have fortified themselves in the national prejudices, if they
would have suffered the alliance; too poor to reckon on any
powerful protectors; and too uncompromising to palliate their
scorn of the whole public system of morals, philosophy, and
religion. The Emperor, the priesthood, and the populace conspired
against them, and they were ordered to the slaughter.</p>

<p>I too had my stimulants to hatred. Where was I? In exile,
in desperate hazard; I had been torn from home, robbed of
my child, made miserable by the fear of apostasy in my
house; and by whom was this comprehensive evil done? The
name of Christian was gall to me. I heard of the popular
vengeance, and called it justice; I saw the distant fires in
which the Christians were being consumed, and calculated how
many each night of those horrors would subtract from the
guilty number. Man becomes cruel by the sight of cruelty,
and when thousands and hundreds of thousands were shouting
for vengeance; when every face looked fury, and every tongue
was wild with some new accusation; when the great and the
little, the philosopher and the ignorant, raised up one roar of
reprobation against the Christian, was the solitary man of
mercy to be looked for in one bleeding from head to foot with
wrongs irreparable?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations for Executions</div>

<p>On one of those dreadful nights, I was gazing from the
housetop on the fire forcing its way through the remaining
quarters, the melancholy gleams through the country showing
the extent of the flight, and in the midst of the blackened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dreary wastes of Rome, the spots of livid flame where the
Christians were perishing at the pile, when I was summoned
to a consultation below.</p>

<p>A Jew had just brought an imperial edict proclaiming pardon
of all offenses to the discoverer of Christians. I would
not have purchased my life by the life of a dog. But my
safety was important to the Jewish cause, and I was pressed
on every side by arguments on the wisdom, nay, the public
duty, of accepting freedom on any terms. And what was to
be the price?—the life of criminals long obnoxious to the laws
and now stained beyond mercy. I loathed delay; I loathed
Rome; I was wild to return to the great cause of my country,
which never could have a fairer hope than now. An emissary
was sent out; money soon effected the discovery of a Christian
assemblage; I appeared before the prætor with my documents,
and brought back in my hand the imperial pardon, given with
the greater good will as the assemblage chanced to comprehend
the chiefs of the heresy. They were seized, ordered
forthwith to the pile, and I was commanded to be present at
this completion of my national service.</p>

<p>The executions were in the gardens of the imperial palace,
which had been thrown open by Nero for the double purpose
of popularity and of indulging himself with the display of
death at the slightest personal inconvenience. The crowd was
prodigious, and to gratify the greatest possible number at once,
those murders were carried on in different parts of the gardens.
In the vineyard, a certain portion were to be crucified; in the
orangery, another portion were to be burned; in the pleasure-ground,
another portion were to be torn by lions and tigers;
gladiators were to be let loose, and when the dusk came on, the
whole of the space was to be lighted by human torches, Christians
wrapped in folds of linen covered with pitch and bitumen,
and thus burning down from the head to the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Christian Martyr</div>

<p>I was horror-struck, but escape was now impossible, and I
must go through the whole hideous round. With my flesh
quivering, my ears ringing, my eyes dim, I was forced to see
miserable beings, men—nay women, nay infants—sewed up
in skins of beasts, and hunted and torn to pieces by dogs; old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
men, whose hoary hairs might have demanded reverence of
savages, scourged, racked, and nailed to the trees to die;
lovely young females, creatures of guileless hearts and innocent
beauty, flung on flaming scaffolds. And this was the
work of man, civilized man, in the highest civilization of the
arts, the manners, and the learning of the pagan world!</p>

<p>But the grand display was prepared for the time when
those Christians who had been denounced on my discovery
were to be executed; an exhibition at which the Emperor himself
announced his intention to be present. The great Circus
was no more, but a temporary amphitheater had been erected,
in which the usual games were exhibited during the early part
of the day. At the hour of my arrival, the low bank circling
this immense enclosure was filled with the first names of
Rome—knights, patricians, senators, military tribunes, consuls;
the Emperor alone was wanting to complete the representative
majesty of the empire. I was to form a part of the
ceremony, and the guard who had me in charge cleared the
way to a conspicuous place, where my national dress fixed
every eye on me. Several Christians had perished before my
arrival. Their remains lay on the ground, and in their midst
stood the man who was to be the next victim.<a name="ENanchor_29" id="ENanchor_29"></a><a href="#Endnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> By what influence
I know not, but never did I see a human being who
made on me so deep an impression. I have him before me at
this instant.</p>

<p>The victims had been generally offered life for recantation,
and this man was giving his reply. I see the figure: low, yet
with an air of nobleness; stooped a little with venerable age,
but the countenance full of life, and marked with all the traits
of intellectual power; the strongly aquiline nose, the bold lip,
the large and rapid eye; the whole man conveying the idea of
an extraordinary permanence of early vigor under the weight
of labor or of years. Even the hair was thick and black, with
scarcely a touch of silver. If the place and time were Athens
and the era of Demosthenes, I should have said that Demosthenes
stood before me. The vivid action; the flashing rapidity
with which he seized a new idea, and compressed it to his
purpose; the impetuous argument that, throwing off the formality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of logic, smote with the strength of a new fact, were
Demosthenic. Even a certain infirmity of utterance, and an
occasional slight difficulty of words, added to the likeness;
but there was a hallowed glance and a solemn yet tender
reach of thought interposed among those intense appeals
that asserted the sacred superiority of the subject and the
man. He was already speaking when I reached the scene of
terrors. I can give but an outline of his language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Christian
Speaks</div>

<p>He pointed to the headless bodies round him.</p>

<p>“For what have these my brethren died? Answer me,
priests of Rome; what temple did they force—what altar
overthrow—what insults offer to the slightest of your public
celebrations? Judges of Rome, what offense did they commit
against the public peace? Consuls, where were they found in
rebellion against the Roman majesty? People of Rome,
whom among your thousands can charge one of these holy
dead with extortion, impurity, or violence; can charge them
with anything but the patience that bore wrong without a
murmur, and the charity that answered tortures only by
prayer?”</p>

<p>He then touched upon the nature of his faith.</p>

<p>“Do I stand here demanding to be believed for opinions?
No, but for facts. I have seen the sick made whole, the
lame walk, the blind receive their sight, by the mere name of
Him whom you crucified. I have seen men, once ignorant of
all languages but their own, speaking with the language of
every nation under heaven; the still greater wonder of the
timid defying all fear, the unlearned instantly made wise in
the mysteries of things divine and human, the peasant putting
to shame the learned—awing the proud, enlightening the
darkened; alike in the courts of kings, before the furious people,
and in the dungeon, armed with an irrepressible spirit of
knowledge, reason, and truth that confounded their adversaries.
I have seen the still greater wonder of the renewed
heart; the impure suddenly abjuring vice; the covetous, the
cruel, the faithless, the godless, gloriously changed into the
holy, the gentle, the faithful, worshipers of the true God in
spirit and in truth—the conquest of the passions which defied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
your philosophers, your tribunals, your rewards, and your terrors,
achieved in the one mighty name. Those are facts,
things which I have seen with these eyes; and who that had
seen them could doubt that the finger of God was there?
Dared I refuse my belief to the divine mission of the Being by
whom, and even in memory of whom, things baffling the
proudest human means were wrought before my senses? Irresistibly
compelled by facts to believe that Christ was sent by
God, I was with equal force compelled to believe in the doctrines
declared by that glorious revealer of the King alike of
quick and dead. And thus I stand before you this day, at
the close of a long life of labor and love, a Christian.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Faith of
a Christian</div>

<p>This appeal to the understanding, divested as it was of all
studied ornament, was listened to by the immense multitude
with the most unbroken interest. It was delivered with the
strong simplicity of conviction. He then spoke of the
Founder of his faith.</p>

<p>“Men may be insane for opinions, but who can be insane
for facts? The coming of Christ was prophesied a thousand
years before! From the beginning of His ministry, He lived
wholly before the eyes of mankind. His life corresponds with
the prophecies in circumstances totally beyond human conjecture,
contrivance, or power. The Virgin Mother, the village
in which He was born, the lowliness of His cradle, the worship
paid to Him there, the hazard of His life—all were predicted.
Could the infant have shaped the accomplishment of
those predictions? The death that He should die, the hands
by which it was to be inflicted, even the draft that He
should drink, the raiment that He should be clothed in, and
the sepulcher in which He should be laid, were predicted.
Could the man have shaped their accomplishment? The time
of His resting in the tomb, His resurrection, His ascent to
heaven, the sending of the Holy Spirit after He was gone—all
were predicted; all were beyond human collusion, human
power, even beyond human thought; all were accomplished!
Is not here the finger of God?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ, the Crucified</div>

<p>“Those things, too, were universally known to the nation
most competent to detect collusion. Did Christ come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Rome, where every new religion finds adherents, and where
all pretensions might be advanced without fear; where a deceiver
might have quoted prophecies that never existed, and
vaunted of wonders done where there was no eye to detect
them? No! His life was spent in Judea. He made His appeal
to the Scriptures, in a country where they were in the
hands of the nation. His miracles were brought before the
eyes of a priesthood that watched him step by step; His doctrines
were spoken, not to the mingled multitude holding a
thousand varieties of opinion, and careless of all, but to an
exclusive race, subtle in their inquiries, eager in their zeal,
and proud of their peculiar possession of divine knowledge.</p>

<p>“Yet against His life, His miracles, or His doctrine, what
charge could they bring? None. There is not a single stigma
on the purity of His conduct; the power of His wonder-working
control over man and nature; the holiness, wisdom,
and grandeur of His views of Providence; the truth,
charity, and meekness of His counsels to man. Their single
source of hatred was the pride of worldly hearts, that expected
a king where they were to have found a teacher.</p>

<p>“Their single charge against Him was His prophecy that
there should be an end to their Temple and their state within
the life of man.</p>

<p>“They crucified Him; He died in prayer, that His murderers
might be forgiven; and His prayer was mightily answered.
He had scarcely risen to His eternal throne when thousands
believed and were forgiven. To Him be the glory, forever
and ever!”</p>

<p>All this was heard in wonder. I could see eyes lifted to
heaven, and lips as if moved in prayer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Face Inspired</div>

<p>“Compare Him with your legislators. He gives the spirit
of all law in a single sentence: ‘Do unto others as you would
they should do unto you.’ Compare Him with your priesthood.
He gives a single prayer, containing the substance of
all that man can rationally implore of heaven. Compare
Him with your moralists. He lays the foundation of virtue
in love to God! Compare him with your sages. He leads a
life of privation without a murmur; He dies a death of shame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
desertion, and agony, and His last breath is mercy! Compare
him with your conquerors. Without the shedding of a drop
of blood He has already conquered hosts that would have resisted
all the swords of earth; hosts of stubborn passions,
cherished vices, guilty perversions of the powers and faculties
of man. In proof of all, look on these glorious dead, whom
I shall join before the set of yonder sun. Yes, martyrs of
God! ye were His conquests, and ye too are more than conquerors,
through Him that loved us and gave Himself for us.
But a triumph shall come, magnificent and terrible, when all
eyes shall behold Him, and the tribes of the earth, even they
who pierced Him, shall mourn.”</p>

<p>Some raged, more listened, many wept. He spoke with
still loftier energy.</p>

<p>“Then rejoice, ye dead! for ye shall rise; ye shall be
clothed with glory; ye shall be as the angels, bright and
powerful, immortal, intellectual kings! ‘For tho worms destroy
this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.’”</p>

<p>He paused, as if he saw the vision.</p>

<p>The sky was cloudless; the sun was in the west, but shining
in his broadest beams; the whole space before me was flooded
with light; when, as I gazed upon the martyr, I saw a gleam
issue from his upturned face; it increased to brightness, to
radiance, to an intense luster that made the sunlight utterly
pale. All was astonishment in the amphitheater, all was
awe. The old man seemed unconscious of the wonder that
invested him. He continued with his open hands lifted up
and his eyes fixed on heaven. The glory spread over his form,
and he stood before us robed in an effulgence which shot from
him, like a living fount of splendor, round the colossal circle.
Yet the blaze, tho it looked the very essence of light, was
strangely translucent; we could see with undazzled eyes every
feature, and whether it was the working of my overwhelmed
mind, or a true change, the countenance appeared to have
passed at once from age to youth. A lofty joy, a look of supernal
grandeur, a magnificent yet ethereal beauty, had transformed
the features of the old man into the likeness of the
winged sons of Immortality!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Christian’s
Prayer</div>

<p>He spoke again, and the first sound of his voice thrilled
through every bosom and made every man start from his
seat.</p>

<p>“Men and brethren! it is the desire of your Father that
all should be saved—Jew and Gentile alike—for with Him
there is no respect of persons. He is the Father of all!
Christianity is not a philosophic dream, but a divine command—the
summons of the God of gods, that you should accept His
mercy—the opening of the gates of an eternal world! It is not
a call to the practise of barren virtue, but a declaration of
reward mightier than the imagination of man can conceive.
Would you be immortals—would you be glorious as the stars
of heaven—would you possess eternal faculties of happiness,
supremacy, and knowledge? Ask for forgiveness of your evil,
in the name of Jesus of Nazareth! What is easier than the
price? What more transcendent than the reward? Who
shall tell the limit of the risen soul? What resistless power,
what more than regal majesty, what celestial beauty may be
in His fame! What expansion of intellect, what overflowing
tides of new sensation, what shapes of loveliness, what radiant
stores of thought and mysteries of exhaustless knowledge,
may be treasured for Him! What endless ascent through
new ranks of being, each as much more glorious than the last
as the risen spirit is above man! For what can be the limit to
the power of God to make those happy, glorious, and mighty
whom He will? For what can be the bound to the fellow heirs
with Christ, their Leader in trial, their Leader in triumph?
Omnipotence for their protector, for their friend, for their
father! He who gave to us His own Son, will He not with
Him give us all things?”</p>

<p>The voice sank into prayer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arrival of Nero</div>

<p>“King of kings! if through a long life I have labored in
Thy cause, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils
by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils
in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in
perils among false brethren, in weariness and painfulness, in
watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness—Thine
alone be the praise, Thine the glory, O Thou who hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
brought me through them all, with a strong hand and an outstretched
arm. And now, Lord, Thou who shalt change my
vile body into the likeness of Thy glorious body, be with Thy
servant in this last hour! Savior and God! receive my spirit,
that where Thou art, even I may be with Thee!”</p>

<p>He was silent; the splendor gradually passed away from
his form, and he knelt upon the sand, bowing his neck to
receive the blow. But to lift a hand against such a being
seemed now an act of profanation. The ax-bearer dared not
approach. The spectators sat hushed in involuntary homage;
and not a word, not a gesture broke the silence of veneration.</p>

<p>At length a flourish of distant trumpets was heard. Cavalry
galloped forward, announcing the Emperor, and Nero,
habited as a charioteer in the games, drove his gilded car into
the arena. The Christian had risen and, with his hands clasped
upon his breast, was awaiting death. Nero cast the headsman
an execration at his tardiness; the ax swept round, and when
I glanced again, the old man lay beside his brethren.</p>

<p>This man I had sacrificed. My heart smote me; I would
have fled the place of blood, but I was in the midst of guards;
more of my victims were to be slain, and I must be the shrinking
witness of all. The Emperor’s arrival commenced the
grand display. He took his place under the curtains of the royal
pavilion. The dead were removed; perfumes were scattered
through the air; rose-water was sprinkled from silver tubes
upon the exhausted multitude; music resounded, incense
burned, and in the midst of those preparations of luxury the
lion-combat began.</p>

<p>A portal of the arena opened and the combatant, with a
mantle thrown over his face and figure, was led in surrounded
by soldiery. The lion roared and ramped against the bars of
its den at the sight. The guard put a sword and buckler into
the hands of the Christian, and he was left alone. He drew
the mantle from his face, and looked slowly and steadily round
the amphitheater. His fine countenance and lofty bearing
raised a universal sound of admiration. He might have stood
for an Apollo encountering the Python. His eyes at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
turned on mine. Could I believe my senses? Constantius
was before me!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius
and the Lion</div>

<p>All my rancor vanished. In the moment before, I could
have struck the betrayer to the heart; I could have called on
the severest vengeance of man and Heaven to smite the destroyer
of my child. But to see him hopelessly doomed; the
man whom I had honored for his noble qualities, whom I had
even loved, whose crime was at worst but the crime of giving
way to the strongest temptation that can bewilder man; to
see this noble creature flung to the savage beast, torn piecemeal
before my eyes—I would have cried to earth and heaven
to save him. But my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth;
I would have thrown myself at the feet of Nero, but I sat like
a man of stone, pale, paralyzed—the beating of my pulse
stopped—my eyes alone alive.</p>

<p>The gate of the den was now thrown back, and the lion
rushed in with a roar and a bound that bore him half across
the arena. I saw the sword glitter in the air; when it waved
again it was covered with blood, and a howl told that the
blow had been driven home. The lion, one of the largest
from Numidia, and made furious by thirst and hunger, an animal
of prodigious power, crouched for an instant as if to make
sure of his prey, crept a few paces onward, and sprang at the
victim’s throat. He was met by a second wound, but his
impulse was irresistible, and Constantius was flung upon the
ground.</p>

<p>A cry of natural horror rang round the amphitheater.
The struggle was now for instant life or death. They rolled
over each other; the lion reared on his hind feet and with
gnashing teeth and distended talons plunged on the man;
again they rose together. Anxiety was now at its wildest
height. The sword swung round the champion’s head in
bloody circles. They fell again. The hand of Constantius
had grasped the lion’s mane, and the furious bounds of the
monster could not loose his hold; but his strength was evidently
giving way; he still struck terrible blows, but each
was weaker than the one before; till, collecting his whole
force for a last effort, he darted one mighty blow into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
lion’s throat and sank. The savage yelled, and, spouting out
blood, fled bellowing round the arena. But the hand still
grasped the mane, and his conqueror was dragged whirling
through the dust at his heels. A universal outcry now arose
to save Constantius, if he were not already dead. But the
lion, tho bleeding from every vein, was still too terrible, and
all shrank from the hazard. At length the grasp gave way
and the body lay motionless on the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Appearance of
Salome</div>

<p>What happened for some moments after I know not.
There was a struggle at the portal; a woman forced her way
through the guards, rushed in alone, and flung herself upon
the victim. The sight of a new prey roused the lion; he tore
the ground with his talons; he lashed his streaming sides with
his tail; he lifted up his mane and bared his fangs. But he
came no longer with a bound; he dreaded the sword, and
crept, snuffing the blood on the sand, and stealing round the
body in circuits still diminishing.</p>

<p>The confusion in the vast assemblage was now extreme.
Voices innumerable called for aid. Women screamed and
fainted. Even the hard-hearted populace, accustomed as
they were to the sacrifices of life, were roused to honest
curses. The guards grasped their arms, and waited but for a
sign of mercy from the Emperor. But Nero gave no sign. I
glanced upon the woman’s face. It was Salome! I sprang
upon my feet. I called on her name; I implored her to fly
from that place of death, to come to my arms, to think of the
agonies of all who loved her.</p>

<p>She had raised the head of Constantius on her knee, and
was wiping the pale visage with her hair. At the sound of
my voice she looked up, and calmly casting back the locks
from her forehead, fixed her gaze upon me. She still knelt;
one hand supported the head, and with the other she pointed to
it, as her only answer. I again adjured her. There was the
silence of death among the thousands round me. A sudden
fire flashed into her eye—her cheek burned. She waved her
hand with an air of superb sorrow.</p>

<p>“I am come to die,” she uttered, in a lofty tone. “This
bleeding body was my husband. I have no father. The world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
contains for me but this clay in my arms. Yet,” and she
kissed the ashy lips before her, “yet, my Constantius, it was
to save that father that your generous heart defied the peril of
this hour. It was to redeem him from the hand of evil that
you abandoned our quiet home! Yes, cruel father, here lies
the preserver who threw open your dungeon, who led you safe
through conflagration, who to the last moment of his liberty
only thought how he might protect you.”</p>

<p>Tears at length fell in floods from her eyes.</p>

<p>“But,” said she, in a tone of wild power, “he was betrayed,
and may the Power whose thunders avenge the cause
of His people pour down just retribution upon the head that
dared——”</p>

<p>I heard my own condemnation about to be unconsciously pronounced
by the lips of my child. Wound up to the last degree
of suffering, I tore my way, leaped on the bars before me,
and plunged into the arena by her side. The height was stunning;
I tottered forward a few paces, and fell. The lion gave
a roar and sprang upon me. I lay helpless under him; I felt
his fiery breath; I saw his lurid eye glaring; I heard the
gnashing of his white fangs above me——</p>

<p>An exulting shout arose. I saw him reel as if struck—gore
filled his jaws. Another mighty blow was driven to his heart.
He sprang high into the air with a howl. He dropped—he
was dead! The amphitheater thundered with acclamation.</p>

<p>With Salome clinging to my bosom, Constantius raised me
from the ground. The roar of the lion had roused him from
his swoon, and two blows saved me. The falchion was broken
in the heart of the monster. The whole multitude stood
up supplicating for our lives, in the name of filial piety and
heroism. Nero, devil as he was, dared not resist the strength
of the popular feeling; he waved a signal to the guards; the
portal was opened, and my children, sustaining my feeble
steps, and showered with garlands and ornaments from innumerable
hands, slowly led me from the arena.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Retrospect</div>

<p>The first rage of the persecution was at an end;<a name="ENanchor_30" id="ENanchor_30"></a><a href="#Endnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the popular
thirst for blood was satiated. The natural admiration that
follows fortitude and innocence, and the natural hatred that
consigns a tyrant to the execration of his time and of posterity,
found their way, and Nero dared murder no more. I
voluntarily shared the prison of Constantius and my child.
Its doors were now set open. The liberality of my people
supplied the means of returning to Judea, and we hastened
down the Tiber in the first vessel that spread her sails from
this throne of desolation.</p>

<p>The chances that had brought us together were soon explained.
Salome, urged to desperation by the near approach
of her marriage, and anxious to save herself from the perjury
of vowing her love to one unpossessed of her heart, had flown
with Constantius to Cæsarea. The only person in their confidence
was the domestic who betrayed me into the hands of
the procurator, and who assisted them only that he might lure
me from home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Return to Judea</div>

<p>At Cæsarea they were wedded, and remained in concealment,
under the protection of the young Septimius. My
transmission to Rome struck them with terror, and Constantius
instantly embarked to save me by his Italian influence.
The attempt was surrounded with peril, but Salome would not
be left behind. Disguised, to avoid my possible refusal of
life at his hands, he followed me step by step. There were
many of our people among the attendants and even in the
higher offices of the court. The Empress had, in her reproaches
to Nero, disclosed the new barbarity of my sentence.
No time was to be lost. Constantius, at the imminent hazard
of life, entered the palace. He saw the block already erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in the garden before the window, where Nero sat inventing a
melody which was to grace my departure. The confusion of
the fire offered the only escape. I was witness of his consternation
when he made so many fruitless efforts to penetrate
to the place where Salome remained in the care of his relatives.
When I scaled the burning mansion, he desperately
followed, lost his way among the ruins, and was giving up all
hope when, wrapped in fire and smoke, Salome fell at his
feet. He bore her to another mansion of his family. It had
given shelter to the chief Christians. They were seized. His
young wife scorned to survive Constantius; and chance and
my own fortunate desperation alone saved me from seeing
their martyrdom.</p>

<p>We returned to Judea. In the first embrace of my family
all was forgotten and forgiven. My brother rejoiced in Salome’s
happiness; and even her rejected kinsman, despite his
reluctance, acknowledged the claims of him who had saved the
life of the father, to the daughter’s hand.</p>

<p>What perception of health is ever so exquisite as when we
first rise from the bed of sickness? What enjoyment of the
heart is so full of delight as that which follows extreme suffering?
I had but just escaped the most formidable personal
hazards; I had escaped the still deeper suffering of seeing
ruin fall on beings whom I would have died to rescue. Salome’s
heart, overflowing with happiness, gave new brightness
to her eyes and new animation to her lovely form. She
danced with involuntary joy, she sang, she laughed; her
fancy kindled into a thousand sparklings. Beautiful being!
in my visions thou art still before me. I clasp thee to my
widowed heart, and hear thy sweet voice, sweeter than the
fountain in the desert to the pilgrim, cheering me in the midst
of my more than pilgrimage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">During the Jubilee</div>

<p>An accession of opulence gave the only increase, if increase
could be given, to the happiness that seemed within my reach.
The year of <span class="smcap">Jubilee</span> arrived. Abolished as the chief customs
of Judea had been by the weakness and guilt of idolatrous
kings and generations, they were still observed by all who
honored the faith of their fathers. The law of Jubilee was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
sacred in our mountains; it was the law of a wisdom and
benevolence above man.</p>

<p>Its peculiar adaptation to Israel, its provision for the virtue
and happiness of the individual, and its safeguard of the
public strength and constitutional integrity, were unrivaled
amongst the finest ordinances of the ancient world.</p>

<p>On the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan, the land was
divided, by the inspired command, among the tribes according
to their numbers. To each family a portion was assigned
as a gift from heaven. The gift was to be inalienable. The
estate might be sold for a period; but in the fiftieth year, on
the evening of the Day of Atonement, in the month of Tishri,
the sound of the trumpets from the sanctuary, echoed by
thousands of voices from every mountain-top, proclaimed the
Jubilee. Then returned, without purchase, every family to
its original possessions. All the more abject degradations
of poverty, the wearing out of families, the hopeless ruin,
were obviated by this great law. The most undone being in
the limits of Judea had still a hold in the land. His ruin
could not be final, perhaps could not extend beyond a few
years; in the last extremity he could not be scorned as one
whose birthright was extinguished; the Jubilee was to raise
him up and place the outcast in the early rank of the sons of
Israel. All the higher feelings were cherished by this incomparable
hope. The man, conscious of his future possessions,
retained the honorable pride of property under the sternest
privations. The time was hurrying on when he should stand
on an equality with mankind, when his worn spirit should begin
the world again with fresh vigor, if he were young; or
when he should sit under the vine and the fig-tree of his fathers,
if his age refused again to struggle for the distinctions
of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Allotment of Naphtali</div>

<p>The agrarian law of Rome and Sparta, feeble efforts to establish
this true foundation of personal and political vigor,
showed at once both the natural impulse and the weakness of human
wisdom. The Roman plunged the people into furious dissensions,
which perished almost in their birth. The Spartan
was secured for a time only by barbarian prohibitions of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and commerce—a code which raised an iron wall against civilization,
turned the people into a perpetual soldiery, and
finally, by the mere result of continual war, overthrew liberty,
dominion, and name.</p>

<p>The Jubilee was for a peculiar people, restricted by a divine
interposition from increase beyond the original number. But
who shall say how far the same benevolent interposition might
not have been extended to all nations, if they had revered the
original compact of heaven with man? How far throughout
the earth the provisions for each man’s wants might not have
been secured—the overwhelming superabundance of portionless
life that fills the world with crime might not have been restrained;
how far despotism, that growth of desperate abjectness
of the understanding and gross corruption of the senses,
might not have been repelled by manly knowledge and native
virtue? But the time may come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Summons of Florus</div>

<p>In the first allotments of the territory, ample domains had
been appointed for the princes and leaders of the tribes. One
of those princedoms now returned to me, and I entered upon
the inheritance of the leaders of Naphtali, a large extent of
hill and valley, rich with corn, olive, and vine. The antiquity
of possession gave a kind of hallowed and monumental
interest to the soil. I was master of its wealth, but I indulged
a loftier feeling in the recollection of those who had
trod the palace and the plain before me. Every chamber bore
the trace of those whom the history of my country had taught
me to reverence; and often, when in some of the fragrant
evenings of summer I have flung myself among the thick beds
of bloom that spread spontaneously over my hills, the spirits
of the loved and honored seemed to gather round me. I saw
once more the matron gravity and the virgin grace; even the
more remote generations, those great progenitors who with
David fought the Philistine; the solemn chieftains who with
Joshua followed the Ark of the Covenant through toil and
battle into the promised land; the sainted sages who witnessed
the giving of the law, and worshiped Him who spake in
thunder from Sinai; all moved before me, for all had trod the
very ground on which I gazed. Could I transfer myself back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to their time, on that spot I should stand among a living
circle of heroic and glorious beings before whose true glory
the pomps of earth were vain; the hearers of the prophets
themselves; the servants of the man of miracle, the companions
of the friend of God; nay, distinction that surpasses human
thought, themselves the chosen of heaven.</p>

<p>The cheering occupations of rural life were to be henceforth
pursued on a scale more fitting my rank. I was the first
chieftain of my tribe, the man by whose wisdom multitudes
were to be guided, and by whose benevolence multitudes were
to be sustained. I felt that mingled sense of rank and responsibility
which with the vain, the ignorant, or the vicious
is the strongest temptation to excess, but with the honorable
and intelligent constitutes the most pleasurable and the most
elevated state of the human mind.</p>

<p>Yet what are the fortunes of man but a ship launched on
an element whose essence is restlessness? The very wind,
without which we can not move, gathers to a storm and we
are undone! The tyranny of our conquerors had for a few
months been paralyzed by the destruction of Rome. But the
governor of Judea was not to be long withheld, where plunder
allured the most furious rapacity that perhaps ever hungered
in the heart of man. I was in the midst of our harvest, surrounded
with the fruitage of the year and enjoying the sights
and sounds of patriarchal life, when I received the formidable
summons to present myself again before Florus. Imprisonment
and torture were in the command. He had heard of my
opulence, and I knew how little his insolent cupidity would
regard the pardon under which I had returned. I determined
to retire into the mountains and defy him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rescue of Septimius</div>

<p>But the Roman plunderer had the activity of his countrymen.
On the very night of my receiving the summons I was
roused from sleep by the outcries of the retainers, who in that
season of heat lay in the open air round the palace. I started
from my bed, only to see with astonishment the courtyards
filled with cavalry, galloping in pursuit of the few peasants
who still fought for their lord. There was no time to be lost;
the torches were already in the hands of the soldiery, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
must be taken or burned alive. Constantius was instantly at
my side. I ordered the trumpet to be sounded on the hills
and we rushed out together, spear in hand. The Romans,
alarmed by resistance where they had counted upon capture
without a blow, fell back. The interval was fatal to them.
Their retreat was intercepted by the whole body of the peasantry,
at length effectually roused. The scythe and reaping-hook
were deadly weapons to horsemen cooped up between
walls, and in midnight. No efforts of mine could stop the
havoc, when once the fury of my people was roused. A few
escaped, who had broken wildly away in the first onset. The
rest were left to cover the avenues with the first sanguinary
offerings of the final war of Judea.</p>

<p>I felt that this escape could be but temporary, for the Roman
policy never forgave until the slightest stain of defeat
was wiped away. All was consternation in my family, and
the order for departure, whatever tears it cost, found no opposition.
In a few hours our camels and mules were loaded,
our horses caparisoned, and we were prepared to quit the
short-lived pomp of the house of my fathers. Constantius
alone did not appear. This noble-minded being had won
even upon me, until I considered him the substitute for my
lost son; and I would run the last hazard rather than leave
him to the Roman mercy. With the women, the interest was
expressed by a declared resolution not to leave the spot until
he was found. The caravan was broken up and all desire of
escape was at an end.</p>

<p>At the close of a day of search through every defile of the
country, he was seen returning at the head of some peasants
bearing a body on a litter. I flew to meet him. He was in
deep affliction, and drawing off the mantle which covered the
face, he showed me Septimius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman Plans</div>

<p>“In the flight of the Romans,” said he, “I saw a horseman
making head against a crowd. His voice caught my ear. I
rushed forward to save him, and he burst through the circle
at full speed. But by the light of the torches I could perceive
that he was desperately wounded. When day broke, I tracked
him by his blood. His horse, gashed by scythes, had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
under him. I found my unfortunate friend lying senseless
beside a rill, to which he had crept for water.”</p>

<p>Tears fell from his eyes as he told the brief story. I too
remembered the generous interposition of the youth, and when
I looked upon the paleness of those fine Italian features that
I had so lately seen lighted up with living spirit, and in a
scene of regal luxury, I felt a pang for the uncertainty of
human things. But the painful part of the moral was spared
us. The young Roman’s wounds were stanched, and in an
enemy and a Roman I found the means of paying a debt of
gratitude. His appearance among the troops sent to seize me
had been only a result of his anxiety to save the father of his
friends. He had accidentally discovered the nature of the
order and hoped to anticipate its execution. But he arrived
only in time to be involved in the confusion of the flight.
Pursued and wounded by the peasantry, he lost his way, and
but for the generous perseverance of Constantius he must
have died.</p>

<p>The public information which he brought was of the most
important kind. In the Roman councils, the utter subjugation
of Judea was resolved on; the last spark of national
independence was to be extinguished, tho in the blood of
the last native; a Roman colony established in our lands;
the Roman worship introduced; and Jerusalem profaned by a
statue of Nero, and sacrifices to him as a god, on the altar of
the sanctuary. To crush the resistance of the people, the
legions, to the number of sixty thousand men, were under
orders from proconsular Asia, Egypt, and Europe. The most
distinguished captain of the empire, Vespasian, was called
from Britain to the command, and the whole military strength
of Rome was prepared to follow up the blow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Principles of War</div>

<p>I summoned the chief men of the tribe. My temperament
was warlike. The seclusion and studies of my early life had
but partially suppressed my natural delight in the vividness
of martial achievement. But the cause that now summoned
me was enough to have kindled the dullest peasant into the
soldier. I had seen the discipline of the enemy; I had made
myself master of their system of war. Fortifications wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a stone could be piled upon a hill; provisions laid up in
large quantities wherever they could be secured; small bodies
of troops practised in maneuver, and perpetually in motion
between the fortresses; a general base of operations to which
all the movements referred—were the simple principles that
had made them conquerors of the world. I resolved to give
them a speedy proof of my pupilage.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Preparing for an Attack</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Hope
of Success</div>

<p>Indecision in the beginning of war is worse than war. I
decided that whatever were the consequences, the sword must
be unsheathed without delay. With Eleazar and Constantius,
I cast my eyes over the map, and examined on what point the
first blow should fall. The proverbial safety of a multitude
of councilors was obviously disregarded in the smallness of
my council; yet few as we were, we differed upon every point
but one, that of the certainty of our danger; the promptitude
of Roman vengeance suffered no contest of opinion. Eleazar,
with a spirit as manly as ever, faced hazard, yet gave his
voice for delay.</p>

<p>“The sole hope of success,” said he, “must depend on rousing
the popular mind. The Roman troops are not to be
beaten by any regular army in the world. If we attack them
on the ordinary principles of war, the result can only be defeat,
slaughter in dungeons, and deeper slavery. If the nation
can be aroused, numbers may prevail over discipline; variety
of attack may distract science; the desperate boldness of the
insurgents may at length exhaust the Roman fortitude, and a
glorious peace will then restore the country to that independence
for which my life would be a glad and ready sacrifice.
But you must first have the people with you, and for that
purpose you must have the leaders of the people——”</p>

<p>“What!” interrupted I, “must we first mingle in the cabals
of Jerusalem and rouse the frigid debaters of the Sanhedrin
into action? Are we first to conciliate the irreconcilable,
to soften the furious, to purify the corrupt? If the Romans
are to be our tyrants till we can teach patriotism to faction,
we may as well build the dungeon at once, for to the dungeon
we are consigned for the longest life among us. Death or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
glory for me. There is no alternative between, not merely
the half slavery that we now live in, and independence, but
between the most condign suffering and the most illustrious
security. If the people would rise through the pressure of
public injury, they must have risen long since; if from private
violence, what town, what district, what family has not its
claim of deadly retribution? Yet here the people stand, after
a hundred years of those continued stimulants to resistance, as
unresisting as in the day when Pompey marched over the
threshold of the Temple. I know your generous friendship,
Eleazar, and fear that your anxiety to save me from the
chances of the struggle may bias your better judgment. But
here I pledge myself, by all that constitutes the honor of man,
to strike at all risks a blow upon the Roman crest that shall
echo through the land. What! commit our holy cause in the
nursing of those pampered hypocrites whose utter baseness of
heart you know still more deeply than I do? Linger till
those pestilent profligates raise their price with Florus by
betraying a design that will be the glory of every man who
draws a sword in it? Vainly, madly ask a brood that, like
the serpent, engender and fatten among the ruins of their
country to discard their venom, to cast their fangs, to feel
for human feelings? As well ask the serpent itself to rise
from the original curse. It is the irrevocable nature of faction
to be base until it can be mischievous; to lick the dust
until it can sting; to creep on its belly until it can twist its
folds around the victim. No! let the old pensionaries, the
bloated hangers-on in the train of every governor, the open
sellers of their country for filthy lucre, betray me when I
leave it in their power. To the field, I say—once and for all,
to the field.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Ardor</div>

<p>My mind, at no period patient of contradiction, was fevered
by the perplexity of the time. I was about to leave the chamber
when Constantius gravely stopped me.</p>

<p>“My father,” said he, with a voice calmer than his countenance,
“you have hurt our noble kinsman’s feelings. It
is not in an hour when our unanimity may fail that we
should suffer dissensions between those whose hearts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
alike embarked in this great cause. Let me mediate between
you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Support

<p>He led Eleazar back from the casement to which he had
withdrawn to cool his blood, burning with the offense of my
language.</p>

<p>“Eleazar is in the right. The Romans are irresistible by
any force short of the whole people. They have military
possession of the country—all your fortresses, all your posts,
all your passes. They are as familiar as you are with every
defile, mountain, and marsh; they surround you with conquered
provinces on the north, east, and south; your western
barrier is open to them while it is shut to you; the sea is the
high-road of their armies, while at their first forbidding, you
dare not launch a galley between Libanus and Idumea. Nothing
can counterbalance this local superiority but the rising of
your whole people.”</p>

<p>“Yet, are we to intrigue with the talkers in Jerusalem for
this?” interrupted I. “What less than a descended thunderbolt
could rouse them to a sense that there is even a heaven
above them?”</p>

<p>“Still, we must have them with us,” said Constantius, “for
we must have all. Universality is the spirit of an insurrectionary
war. If I were commander of a revolt, I should feel
greater confidence of success at the head of a single province
in which every human being was against the enemy, than
at the head of an empire partially in arms. The mind
even of the rudest spearsman is a great portion of him.
The boldest shrinks from the consciousness that hostility is
on all sides; that whether marching or at rest, watching
or sleeping, by night or by day, hostility is round him; that
it is in the very air he breathes, in the very food he eats; that
every face he sees is the face of one who wishes him slain;
that every knife, even every trivial instrument of human use,
may be turned into a shedder of his blood. Those things,
perpetually confronting his mind, break it down until the
man grows reckless, miserable, undisciplined, and a dastard.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” observed Eleazar, “the constant robbery of an insurrectionary
war must render it a favorite command.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius
Describes
a Campaign</div>

<p>“Let me speak from experience,” said Constantius. “Two
years ago I was attached, with a squadron of galleys, to the
expedition against the tribes of Mount Taurus. While the
galleys wintered in Cyprus, I followed the troops up the hills.
Nothing had been omitted that would counteract the severity
of the season. Tents, provisions, clothing adapted to the
hills, even luxuries despatched from the islands, gave the
camps almost the indulgences of cities. The physical hardships
of the campaign were trivial compared with those of
hundreds in which the Romans had beaten regular armies.
Yet the discontent was indescribable, from the perpetual
alarms of the service. The mountaineers were not numerous
and were but half armed; they were not disciplined at all.
A Roman centurion would have outmaneuvered all their captains.
But they were brave; they knew nothing but to kill
or be killed, and it made no difference to them whether Death
did his work by night or by day. Sleep to us was scarcely
possible. To sit down on a march was to be leveled at by a
score of arrows; to pursue the archers was to be lured into
some hollow, where a fragment of the rock above or a felled
tree, was ready to crush the legionaries. We chased them
from hill to hill; we might as well have chased the vultures
and eagles that duly followed us, with the perfect certainty
of not being disappointed of their meal. Wherever the enemy
showed themselves they were beaten, but our victory was totally
fruitless. The next turn of the mountain road was a
stronghold, from which we had to expect a new storm of arrows,
lances, and fragments of rock.</p>

<p>“The mountaineers always had a retreat,” he continued.
“If we drove them from the pinnacles of the hills, they were
in a moment in the valleys, where we must follow them at the
risk of falling down precipices and being swallowed up by torrents,
in which the strongest swimmer in the legions could not
live for a moment. If we drove them from the valleys, we saw
them scaling the mountains as if they had wings, and scoffing at
our tardy and helpless movements, encumbered as we were with
baggage and armor. We at length forced our way through
the mountain range, and when with the loss of half the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
we had reached their citadel, we found that the work was to
be begun again. To remain where we were was to be starved;
we had defeated the barbarians, but they were as unconquered
as ever, and our only resource was to retrace our steps, which
we did at the expense of a battle every morning, noon,
evening, and night, with a ruinous loss of life and the total
abandonment of everything in the shape of baggage. The
defeat was of course hushed up, and according to the old
Roman policy, the escape was colored to a victory; I had the
honor of carrying back the general into Italy, where he was
decreed an ovation, a laurel crown, and a crowd of the usual
distinctions; but the triumph belonged to the men of the
mountains, and until our campaign is forgotten, no Roman
captain will look for his laurels in Mount Taurus again.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Force of
Invasion</div>

<p>“Such forever be the fate of wars against the natural freedom
of the brave,” said I; “but the Cicilians had the advantage
of an almost impenetrable country. Three-fourths of
Judea is already in the enemy’s possession.”</p>

<p>“No country in which man can exist can be impenetrable to
an invading army,” was the reply. “Natural defenses are
trifling before the vigor and dexterity of man. The true barrier
is in the hearts of the defenders. We were masters of
the whole range. We could not find a thousand men assembled
on any one point. Yet we were not the actual possessors
of a mile of ground beyond the square of our camp. We
never saw a day without an attack, nor ever lay down at night
without the certainty of some fierce attempt at a surprise. It
was this perpetual anxiety that broke the spirits of the troops.
All was in hostility to them. They felt that there was not a
secure spot within the horizon. Every man whom they saw,
they knew to be one who either had drawn Roman blood or
who longed in his inmost soul to draw it. They dared not
pass by a single rock without a search for a lurking enemy.
Even a felled tree might conceal some daring savage, who was
content to die on the Roman spears, after having flung his
unerring lance among the ranks or shot an arrow that went
through the thickest corslet. I have seen the boldest of the
legionaries sink on the ground in absolute exhaustion of heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
with this hopeless and wearying warfare. I have seen men
with muscles strong as iron weep like children through
mere depression. With the harsher spirits, all was execration
and bitterness, even to the verge of mutiny. With the more
generous all was regret at the waste of honor, mingled with
involuntary admiration of the barbarians who thus defied the
haughty courage and boasted discipline of the conquerors of
mankind. The secret spring of their resistance was its universality.
Every man was embarked in the common cause.
There was no room for evasion under cover of a party disposed
to peace; there was no Roman interest among the people,
in which timidity or selfishness could take refuge. The
national cause had not a lukewarm friend; the invaders had
not a dubious enemy. The line was drawn with the sword,
and the cause of national independence triumphed, as it ought
to triumph.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Determination</div>

<p>“But we are a people split into as many varieties of opinion
as there are provinces or even villages in Judea,” observed
Eleazar; “the Jew loves to follow the opinions of the head
of his family, the chief man of his tribe, or even of the priest,
who has long exercised an influence over his district. We
have not the slavishness of the Asiatic, but we still want the
personal choice of the European. We must secure the leaders,
if we would secure the people.”</p>

<p>“Men,” said Constantius, “are intrinsically the same in
every climate under heaven. They will all hate hazard, where
nothing but hazard is to be gained. They will all linger for
ages in slavery, where the taskmaster has the policy to avoid
sudden violence; but they will all encounter the severest
trials, where in the hour of injury they find a leader prepared
to guide them to honor.”</p>

<p>“And to that extent they shall have trial of me!” I exclaimed.
“Before another Sabbath I shall make the experiment
of my fitness to be the leader of my countrymen. At the
head of my own tribe I will march to the Holy City, seize the
garrison, and from Herod’s palace, from the very chair of
the Procurator, will I at once silence the voice of faction and
lift the banner to the tribes of Israel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stronghold
of Masada</div>

<p>“Nobly conceived,” said Constantius, his countenance
glowing with animation; “blow upon blow is the true tactic
of an insurrectionary war. We must strike at once, suddenly,
and boldly. The sword of him who would triumph in a revolt
must not merely sound on the enemy’s helmet, but cut
through it.”</p>

<p>“Yet to a march on Jerusalem,” said Eleazar, “the objections
are palpable. The city would be out of all hope of a
surprise, difficult to capture, and beyond all chance to keep.”</p>

<p>“Ever tardy, thwarting, and contradictory!” I exclaimed;
“if the Roman scepter lay under my heel, I should find Eleazar
forbidding me to crush it. My mind is fixed; I will hear
no more.”</p>

<p>I started from my seat and paced the chamber. Eleazar
approached me.</p>

<p>“My brother,” said he, holding out his hand with a forgiving
smile, “<em>we</em> must not differ. I honor your heart,
Salathiel; I know your talents; there is not a man in Judea
whom I should be prouder to see at the head of its councils.
I agree with you in your views, and now I offer you myself
and every man whom I can influence to follow you to the
last extremity. The only question is, where the blow is to
fall.”</p>

<p>Constantius had been gazing on the chart of Judea, which
lay between us on the table.</p>

<p>“If it be our object,” said he, “to combine injury to the
Romans with actual advantage to ourselves, to make a trial
where failure can not be ruinous and where success may be
of measureless value, here is the spot.” He pointed to
Masada.<a name="ENanchor_31" id="ENanchor_31"></a><a href="#Endnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The fortress of Masada was built by Herod the Great as
his principal magazine of arms. A fierce and successful soldier,
one of his luxuries was the variety and costliness of his
weapons, and the royal armory of Masada was renowned
throughout Asia. Pride in the possession of such a trophy,
probably aided by some reverence for the memory of the friend
of Cæsar and Antony, whom the legions still almost worshiped
as tutelar genii, originally saved it from the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Roman spoliation. But no native foot was permitted to enter
the armory, and mysterious stories of the sights and sounds of
those splendid halls filled the ears of the people. Masada
was held to be the talisman of the Roman power over Judea
by more than the people; the belief had made its way among
the legions, and no capture could be a bolder omen of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Preparations</div>

<p>I still preferred the more direct blow on Jerusalem, and
declaimed on the vital importance in all wars, of seizing on
the capital. But I was controlled. Eleazar’s grave wisdom
and the science of Constantius deprived me of argument, and
the attack on Masada was finally planned before we left the
chamber. Nothing could be more primitive than our plan for
the siege of the most scientific fortification in Judea, crowded
with men and furnished with every implement and machine
of war that Roman experience could supply. Our simple
preparations were a few ropes for ladders, a few hatchets for
cutting down gates and palisadoes, and a few faggots for setting
on fire what we could. Five hundred of our tribe, who
had never thrown a lance but in hunting, formed our expedition,
and at the head of those, Constantius, who claimed the
exploit by the right of discovery, was to march at dusk, conceal
himself in the forests during the day, and on the evening
of his arrival within reach of the fortress attempt it by surprise.
Eleazar was, in the mean time, to rouse his retainers,
and I was to await at their head the result of the enterprise,
and if successful, unfurl the standard of Naphtali and advance
on Jerusalem.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Departure of Constantius</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Hour of
Banquet</div>

<p>The remainder of this memorable day lingered on with a
tardiness beyond description. The criminal who counts the
watches of the night before his execution has but a faint image
of that hot and yet pining anxiety, that loathing of all
things unconnected with the one mighty event, that mixture
of hopelessness and hope, that morbid nervousness of every
fiber in his frame, which make up the suspense of the conspirator
in even the noblest cause.</p>

<p>When the hour of banquet came, I sat down in the midst of
magnificence, as was the custom of my rank. The table was
filled with guests; all around me was gaiety and pomp, high-born
men, handsome women, richly attired attendants; plate,
the work of Tyrian and Greek artists, in its massive beauty;
walls covered with tissues; music filling the air cooled by
fountains of perfumed waters. I felt as little of them as if
I were in the wilderness. The richest wines, the most delicate
fruits, palled on my taste. If I had one wish, it was
that for the next forty-eight hours oblivion might amount to
insensibility! At my wife and daughters I ventured but one
glance. I thought that I had never before seen them look so
fitted to adorn their rank, to be the models of grace, loveliness,
and honor, to society, and the thought smote my heart—how
soon may all this be changed!</p>

<p>My eyes sought Constantius; he had just returned from his
preparations, and came in glowing with the enthusiasm of the
soldier. He sat down beside Salome, and his cheek gradually
turned to the hue of death. He sat like myself, absorbed
in frequent reverie, and to the playful solicitations of Salome
that he would indulge in the table after his fatigue, he gave
forced smiles and broken answers. The future was plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
busy with us both; with all that the heart of man could love
beside him, he felt the pang of contrast, and when on accidentally
lifting his eyes, they met mine, the single conscious
look interchanged told the perturbation that preyed on both
in the heart’s core.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius
Seeks
Salathiel</div>

<p>I soon rose, and under pretense of having letters to despatch
to our friends in Rome, retired to my chamber. There
lay the chart still on the table, the route to Masada marked
by pencil lines. With what breathlessness I now traced
every point and bearing of it! There, within a space over
which I could stretch my arm, was my world. In that little
boundary was I to struggle against the supremacy that covered
the earth! Those fairy hills, those scarcely visible rivers,
those remote cities, dots of human habitation, were to be
henceforth the places of siege and battle, memorable for the
destruction of human life, engrossing every energy of myself
and my countrymen, and big with the fates of generations on
generations.</p>

<p>It was dusk, and I was still devouring with my eyes this
chart of prophecy when Constantius entered.</p>

<p>“I have come,” said he gravely, “to bid you farewell
for the night. In two days I hope we shall all meet again.”</p>

<p>“No, my brave son,” I interrupted, “we do not leave each
other to-night.”</p>

<p>He looked surprised. “I must be gone this instant. Eleazar
has done his part with the activity of his honest and
manly mind. Two miles off, in the valley under the date-grove,
I have left five hundred of the finest fellows that ever
sat a charger. In half an hour Sirius rises; then we go, and
let the governor of Masada look to it! Farewell, and wish
me good fortune.”</p>

<p>“May every angel that protects the righteous cause hover
above your head!” I exclaimed; “but no farewell, for we go
together.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius Departs</div>

<p>“Do you doubt my conduct of the enterprise?” asked
he strongly. “’Tis true I have been in the Roman service,
but that service I hated from the bottom of my soul. I was
a Greek and bound to Rome no longer than she could hold me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in her chain. If I could have found men to follow me, I
should have done in Cyprus what I now do in Judea. The
countryman of Leonidas, Cimon, and Timeleon was not born
to hug his slavery. I am now a son of Judea; to her my
affections have been transplanted, and to her, if she does not
reject me, shall my means and my life be given.”</p>

<p>He relaxed the belt from his waist and dropped it with
his simitar on the ground. I lifted it and placed it again in
his hand.</p>

<p>“No, Constantius,” I replied, “I honor your zeal, and
would confide in you if the world hung upon the balance.
But I can not bear the thought of lingering here while you are
in the field. My mind, within these few hours, has been on
the rack. I must take the chances with you.”</p>

<p>“It is utterly impossible,” was his firm answer; “your
absence would excite instant suspicion. The Roman spies are
everywhere. The natural result follows, that our march
would be intercepted, and I am not sure but that even now
we may be too late. That inconceivable sagacity by which
the Romans seem to be masters of every man’s secret has
been already at work; troops were seen on the route to Masada
this very day. Let it be known that the prince of
Naphtali has left his palace, and the dozen squadrons of Thracian
horse which I saw within those four days at Tiberias will
be riding through your domains before the next sunset.”</p>

<p>This reflection checked me. “Well then,” said I, “go, and
the protection of Him whose pillar of cloud led His people
through the sea and through the desert be your light in the
hour of peril!”</p>

<p>I pressed his hand; he turned to depart, but came back, and
after a slight hesitation said: “If Salome had once offended
her noble father by her flight, the offense was mine. Forgive
her, for her heart is still the heart of your child. She loves
you. If I fall, let the memory of our disobedience lie in my
grave!”</p>

<p>His voice stopped, and mine could not break the silence.</p>

<p>“Let what will come,” resumed he with an effort, “tell
Salome that the last word on my lips was her name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Festal
Scene</div>

<p>He left the chamber, and I felt as if a portion of my being
had gone forth from me.</p>

<p>This day was one of the many festivals of our country, and
my halls echoed with sounds of enjoyment. The immense
gardens glittered with illumination in all the graceful devices
of which our people were such masters, and when I looked
out for the path of Constantius, I was absolutely pained by
the sight of so much fantastic pleasure while my hero was
pursuing his way through darkness and danger.</p>

<p>At length the festival was over. The lights twinkled
fainter among the arbors, the sounds of glad voices sank, and I
saw from my casement the evidences of departure in the trains
of torches that moved up the surrounding hills. The sight of
a starlit sky has always been to me among the softest and
surest healers of the heart, and I gazed upon that mighty
scene which throws all human cares into such littleness, until
my composure returned.</p>

<p>The last of the guests had left the palace before I ventured
to descend. The vases of perfumes still breathed in the hall
of the banquet; the alabaster lamps were still burning; but
excepting the attendants who waited on my steps at a distance,
and whose fixed figures might have been taken for statues,
there was not a living being near me of the laughing and
joyous crowd that had so lately glittered, danced, and smiled
within those sumptuous walls. Yet what was this but a picture
of the common rotation of life? Or by a yet more immediate
moral, what was it but a picture of the desertion that
might be coming upon me and mine? I sat down to extinguish
my sullen philosophy in wine. But no draft that
ever passed the lip could extinguish the fever that brooded on
my spirit. I dreaded that the presence of my family might
force out my secret, and lingered with my eyes gazing, without
sight, on the costly covering of the board.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Beautiful Group</div>

<p>A sound of music from an inner hall to which Miriam and
her daughters had retired, aroused me. I stood at the door,
gazing on the group within. The music was a hymn with
which they closed the customary devotions of the day. But
there was something in its sound to me that I had never felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
before. At the moment when those sweet voices were pouring
out the gratitude of hearts as innocent and glowing as the
hearts of angels, a scene of horror might be acting. The husband
of Salome might be struggling with the Roman sword;
nay, he might be lying a corpse under the feet of the cavalry,
that before morn might bring the news of his destruction in
the flames that might startle us from our sleep, and the
swords that might pierce our bosoms.</p>

<p>And what beings were those thus appointed for the sacrifice?
The lapse of even a few years had perfected the natural
beauty of my daughters. Salome’s sparkling eye was
more brilliant; her graceful form was molded into more easy
elegance, and her laughing lip was wreathed with a more playful
smile. Never did I see a creature of deeper witchery.
My Esther, my noble and dear Esther, who was perhaps the
dearer to me from her inheriting a tinge of my melancholy,
yet a melancholy exalted by genius into a charm, was this
night the leader of the song of holiness. Her large uplifted
eye glowed with the brightness of one of the stars on which
it was fixed. Her hands fell on the harp in almost the attitude
of prayer, and the expression of her lofty and intellectual
countenance, crimsoned with the theme, told of a communion
with thoughts and beings above mortality. The hymn was
done, the voices had ceased, yet the inspiration still burned
in her soul; her hands still shook from the chords’ harmonies,
sweet, but of the wildest and boldest brilliancy; bursts and
flights of sound, like the rushing of the distant waterfall at
night, or the strange, solemn echoes of the forest in the first
swell of the storm.</p>

<p>Miriam and Salome sat beholding her in silent admiration
and love. The magnificent dress of the Jewish female
could not heighten the power of such beauty; but it filled
up the picture. The jeweled tiaras, the embroidered shawls,
the high-wrought and massive armlets, the silken robes
and sashes fringed with pearl and diamond, the profusion
of dazzling ornament that form the Oriental costume to
this day, were the true habits of the beings that then sat, unconscious
of the delighted yet anxious eye that drank in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
joy of their presence. I saw before me the pomp of princedoms,
investing forms worthy of thrones.</p>

<p>My entrance broke off the harper’s spell, and I found it a
hard task to answer the touching congratulations that flowed
upon me. But the hour waned, and I was again left alone
for the few minutes which it was my custom to give to meditation
before I retired to rest. I threw open the door that
led into a garden thick with the Persian rose and filling
the air with cool fragrance. At my first glance upward, I saw
Sirius—he was on the verge of the horizon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fate of
Constantius</div>

<p>The thoughts of the day again gathered over my soul. I
idly combined the fate of Constantius with the decline
of the star that he had taken for his signal. My senses lost
their truth, or contributed to deceive me. I fancied that I heard
sounds of conflict; the echo of horses’ feet rang in my ears.
A meteor that slowly sailed across the sky struck me as a
supernatural summons. My brain, fearfully excitable since
my great misfortune, at length kindled up such strong realities
that I found myself on the point of betraying the burden of
my spirit by some palpable disclosure.</p>

<p>Twice had I reached the door of Miriam’s chamber to tell
her my whole perplexity. But I heard the voice of her attendants
within and again shrank from the tale. I ranged the
long galleries perplexed with capricious and strange torments
of the imagination.</p>

<p>“If he should fall,” said I, “how shall I atone for the cruelty
of sending him upon a service of such hopeless hazard—a
few peasants with naked breasts against Roman battlements?
What soldier would not ridicule my folly in hoping success;
what man would not charge me with scorn of the life of my
kindred? The blood of my tribe will be upon my head forever.
There sinks the prince of Naphtali! In the grave of
my gallant son and his companions is buried my dream of
martial honor; the sword that strikes him cuts to the ground
my last ambition of delivering my country.”</p>

<p>The advice of Constantius returned to my mind, but like the
meeting of two tides, it was only to increase the tumult within.
I felt the floor shake under my hurried tread. I smote my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
forehead—it was covered with drops of agony. The voices
within my wife’s chamber had ceased. But was I to rouse her
from her sleep, perhaps the last quiet sleep that she was ever
to take, only to hear intelligence that must make her miserable?</p>

<p>I leaned my throbbing forehead upon one of the marble
tables, as if to imbibe coolness from the stone. I felt a light
hand upon mine. Miriam stood beside me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miriam’s
Comfort</div>

<p>“Salathiel!” pronounced she in an unshaken voice, “there
is something painful on your mind. Whether it be only a
duty on your part to disclose it to me, I shall not say; but if
you think me fit to share your happier hours, must I have the
humiliation of feeling that I am to be excluded from your confidence
in the day when those hours may be darkened?”</p>

<p>I was silent, for to speak was beyond my strength, but I
pressed her delicate fingers to my bosom.</p>

<p>“Misfortune, my dear husband,” resumed she, “is trivial
but when it reaches the mind. Oh, rather let me encounter
it in the bitterest privations of poverty and exile; rather let
me be a nameless outcast to the latest year I have to live, than
feel the bitterness of being forgotten by the heart to which,
come life or death, mine is bound forever and ever.”</p>

<p>I glanced up at her. Tears dropped on her cheeks, but her
voice was firm.</p>

<p>“I have observed you,” said she, “in deep agitation during
the day, but I forbore to press you for the cause. I have listened
now, till long past midnight, to the sound of your feet,
to the sound of groans and pangs wrung from your bosom;
nay, to exclamations and broken sentences which have let me
most involuntarily into the knowledge that this disturbance
arises from the state of our country. I know your noble nature,
and I say to you, in this solemn and sacred hour of
danger, follow the guidance of that noble nature.”</p>

<p>I cast my arms about her neck and imprinted upon her lips
a kiss as true as ever came from human love. She had taken
a weight from my soul. I detailed the whole design to her.
She listened with many a change from red to pale, and
many a tremor of the white hand that lay in mine. When I
ceased, the woman in her broke forth in tears and sighs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yet,” said she, “you must go to the field. Dismiss the
thought that for the selfish desire of looking even upon you
in safety here I should hazard the dearer honor of my lord.
It is right that Judea should make the attempt to shake off
her tyranny. The people can never be deceived in their own
cause. Kings and courts may be deluded into the choice of
incapacity, but the man whom a people will follow from their
firesides must bear the stamp of a leader.”</p>

<p>“Admirable being!” I exclaimed, “worthy to be honored
while Israel has a name! Then I have your consent to follow
Constantius. By speed I may reach him before he can
have arrived at the object of the enterprise. Farewell, my
best-beloved—farewell!”</p>

<p>She fell into my arms in a passion of tears, but at length
recovered and said:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Go, Prince of
Naphtali!</div>

<p>“This is weakness, the mere weakness of surprise. Yes;
go, prince of Naphtali. No man must take the glory from
you. Constantius is a hero, but you must be a king, and more
than a king; not the struggler for the glories of royalty, but
for the glories of the rescuer of the people of God. The
first blow of the war must not be given by another, dear as
he is. The first triumph, the whole triumph, must be my
lord’s.”</p>

<p>She knelt down and poured out her soul to Heaven in eloquent
supplication for my safety. I listened in speechless
homage.</p>

<p>“Now go,” sighed she, “and remember in the day of battle
who will then be in prayer for you. Court no unnecessary
peril, for if you perish, which of us would desire to live?”</p>

<p>She again sank upon her knees, and I in reverent silence
descended from the gallery.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Salathiel in Strange Company</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">On the Road</div>

<p>My preparations were quickly made. I divested myself of
my robes, led out my favorite barb, flung a haik over my
shoulders, and by the help of my Arab turban might have
passed for a plunderer in any corner of Syria. This was done
unseen by any eye, for the crowd of attendants that thronged
the palace in the day were now stretched through the courts,
or on the terraces, fast asleep, under the double influence of a
day of feasting and a night of tepid summer air. I rode without
stopping until the sun began to throw up his yellow rays
through the vapors of the Lake of Tiberias. Then to ascertain
alike the progress of Constantius and to avoid the chances
of meeting with some of those Roman squadrons which were
continually moving between the fortresses, I struck off the
road into a forest, tied my barb to a tree, and set forth to
reconnoiter the scene.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Meets Strangers</div>

<p>Traveling on foot was the common mode in a country
which, like Judea, was but little fitted for the breed of horses,
and I found no want of companions. Pedlers, peasants, disbanded
soldiers, and probably thieves diversified my knowledge
of mankind within a few miles. I escaped under the
sneer of the soldier and the compassion of the peasant. The
first glance at my wardrobe satisfied the robber that I was not
worth the exercise of his profession, or perhaps that I was a
brother of the trade. I here found none of the repulsiveness
that makes the intercourse of higher life so unproductive.
Confidence was on every tongue, and I discovered, even in
the sandy ways of Palestine, that to be a judicious listener is
one of the first talents for popularity all over the world. But
of my peculiar objects I could learn nothing, though every
man whom I met had some story of the Romans. I ascertained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to my surprise, that the intelligence which Septimius
brought from the imperial cabinet was known to the multitude.
Every voice of the populace was full of tales, probably
reckoned among the profoundest secrets of the state. I have
made the same observation in later eras, and found, even in
the most formal mysteries of the most frowning governments,
the rumor of the streets outruns the cabinets. So it must be
while diplomatists have tongues and while women and domestics
have curiosity.</p>

<p>But if I were to rely on the accuracy of those willing politicians,
the cause of independence was without hope. Human
nature loves to make itself important, and the narrator of the
marvelous is always great, according to the distention of his
news. Those who had seen a cohort, invariably magnified it
into a legion; a troop of cavalry covered half a province; and
the cohorts marching from Asia Minor and Egypt for our garrisons,
were reckoned by the very largest enumeration within
the teller’s capacity.</p>

<p>As I was sitting by a rivulet, moistening some of the common
bread of the country which I had brought to aid my disguise,
I entered into conversation with one of those unhoused
exiles of society whom at the first glance we discern to be
nature’s commoners, indebted to no man for food, raiment, or
habitation, the native dweller on the road. He had some of
the habitual jest of those who have no care, and congratulated
me on the size of my table, the meadow, and the unadulterated
purity of my potation, the brook. He informed me that he
came direct from the Nile, where he had seen the son of Vespasian
at the head of a hundred thousand men. A Syrian
soldier, returning to Damascus, who joined our meal, felt indignant
at the discredit thus thrown on a general under whom
he had received three pike-wounds and leave to beg his way
home. He swore by Ashtoreth that the force under Titus was
at least twice the number.</p>

<p>A third wanderer, a Roman veteran, of whom the remainder
was covered over with glorious patches, arrived just in time
to relieve his general from the disgrace of so limited a command,
and another hundred thousand was instantly put under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
his orders; sanctioned by asseverations in the name of Jupiter
Capitolinus, and as many others of the calendar as the patriot
could pronounce. This rapid recruiting threw the former
authorities into the background, and the old legionary was,
for the rest of the meal, the undisputed leader of the conversation.
They had evidently heard some rumor of our preparations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Conversation</div>

<p>“To suppose,” said the veteran, “that those circumcized
dogs can stand against a regular-bred Roman general is sacrilege.
Half his army, or a tenth of his army, would walk
through the land, north and south, east and west, as easily as
I could walk through this brook.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” said the Syrian, “if they had some of
our cavalry for flanking and foraging.”</p>

<p>“Aye, for anything but fighting, comrade,” said the Roman
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No; you leave out another capital quality,” observed the
beggar, “for none can deny that whoever may be first in the
advance, the Syrians will be first in the retreat. There are
two maneuvers to make a complete soldier—how to get into
the battle, and how to get out of it. Now, the Syrians manage
the latter in the most undoubted perfection.”</p>

<p>“Silence, villain,” exclaimed the Syrian, “or you have
robbed your last hen-roost in this world.”</p>

<p>“He says nothing but the truth for all that,” interrupted
the veteran. “But neither of us taxed your cavalry with cowardice.
No; it was pure virtue. They had too much modesty
to take the way into the field before other troops, and too
much humanity not to teach them how to sleep without broken
bones.”</p>

<p>The beggar, delighted at the prospect of a quarrel, gave the
assent that more embroiled the fray.</p>

<p>“Mark Antony did not say so,” murmured the indignant
Syrian.</p>

<p>“Mark Antony!” cried the Roman, starting upon his single
leg, “glory to his name! But what could a fellow like
you know about Mark Antony?”</p>

<p>“I only served with him,” dryly answered the Syrian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Hears
of Masada</div>

<p>“Then here’s my hand for you,” exclaimed the brave old
man, “we are comrades. I would love even a dog that had
seen the face of Mark Antony. He was the first man that I
ever carried buckler under. Aye, there was a soldier for you;
such men are not made in this puling age. He could fight
from morn till night, and carouse from night till morn, and
never lose his seat on his charger in the field the day after.
I have seen him run half naked through the snows in Armenia,
and walk in armor in the hottest day of Egypt. He
loved the soldier, and the soldier loved him. So, comrade,
here’s to the health of Mark Antony. Ah, we shall never see
such men again.”</p>

<p>He drew out a flask of ration wine, closely akin to vinegar,
of which he hospitably gave us each a cup, and after pouring
a libation to his hero’s memory, whom he evidently placed
among his gods, swallowed the draft, in which we devoutly
followed his example.</p>

<p>“Yet,” said the beggar, “if Antony was a great man, he
has left little men enough behind him. There’s, for instance,
the present gay procurator—six months in the gout, the other
six months drunk, or if sober only thinking where he can rob
next. This will bring the government into trouble before long,
or I’m much mistaken. For my part, I pledge myself if he
should take any part of my property——”</p>

<p>“Why, if he did,” said the Syrian, “I give him credit for
magic. He could find a crop of wheat in the sand or coin
money out of the air. Where does your estate lie?”</p>

<p>“Comrade,” said the veteran, laughing, “recollect; if the
saying be true that people are least to be judged of by the
outside, the rags of our jovial friend must hide many a shekel;
and as to where his estate lies, he has a wide estate who has
the world for his portion, and money enough who thinks all
his own that he can lay his fingers on.”</p>

<p>The laugh was now loud against the beggar. He, however,
bore all, like one accustomed to the buffets of fortune, and,
joining in it, said:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dreams of Beggars</div>

<p>“Whatever may be my talents in that way, there is no
great chance of showing them in this company; but if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
should be present at the sack of Masada, and I should meet
you on your way back——”</p>

<p>“Masada!” exclaimed I instinctively.</p>

<p>“Yes, I left the town three days ago. On that very morning
an order arrived to prepare for the coming of the great
and good Florus, who in his wisdom, feeling the want of
gold, has determined to fill up the hollows of the military
chest and his own purse by stripping the armory of everything
that can sell for money. My intelligence is from the
best authority. The governor’s principal bath-slave told it to
one of the damsels of the steward’s department, with whom
the Ethiopian is mortally in love, and the damsel, in a moment
of confidence, told it to me. In fact, to let you into <em>my</em>
secret, I am now looking out for Florus, in whose train I intend
to make my way back into this gold-mine.”</p>

<p>“The villain!” cried the veteran; “disturb the arms of the
dead! Why, they say that it has the very corselet and buckler
that Mark Antony wore when he marched against the Idumeans.”</p>

<p>“I fear more the disturbance of the arms of the living,”
said the Syrian; “the Jews will take it for granted that the
Romans are giving up the business in despair, and if I’m a
true man, there will be blood before I get home.”</p>

<p>“No fear of that, fellow soldier,” said the veteran gaily;
“you have kept your two legs, and when they have so long
carried you out of harm’s way, it would be the worst treatment
possible to leave you in it at last. But there is something
in what you say. I had a dream last night. I thought
that I saw the country in a blaze, and when I started from my
sleep, my ears were filled with a sound like the trampling of
ten thousand cavalry.”</p>

<p>I drew my breath quickly, and to conceal my emotion, gathered
up the fragments of our meal. On completing my work,
I found the beggar’s eye fixed on me,—he smiled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Discovered</div>

<p>“I too had a dream last night,” said he, “and of much the
same kind. I thought that I saw a cloud of cavalry, riding
as fast as horse could lay hoof to ground; I never saw a more
dashing set since my first campaign upon the highways of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
wicked world. I’ll be sworn that whatever their errand may
be, such riders will not come back without it. Their horses’
heads were turned toward Masada, and I am now between two
minds, whether I may not mention my dream to the procurator
himself.”</p>

<p>I found his keen eye turned on me again.</p>

<p>“Absurd!” said I; “he would recommend you only to his
lictor.”</p>

<p>“I rather think he would recommend me to his treasurer,
for I never had a dream that seemed so like a fact. I should
not be surprised to find that I had been sleeping with my eyes
open.”</p>

<p>His look convinced me that I was known! I touched his
hand, while the soldiers were busy packing up their cups, and
showed him gold. He smiled carelessly. I laid my hand on
my poniard; he but smiled again.</p>

<p>“The sun is burning out,” said he, “and I can stand talking
here no longer. Farewell, brave soldiers, and safe home
to you! Farewell, Arab, and safe home to those that you are
looking after!”</p>

<p>He stalked away, and as he passed me, said in a low voice,
“Glory to Naphtali!”</p>

<p>After exchanging good wishes with the old men, I followed
him; he led the way toward the wood at a pace which kept
me at a distance. When I reached the shade, he stopped,
and prostrated himself before me.</p>

<p>“Will my lord,” said he, “forgive the presumption of his
servant? This day, when I first met you, your disguise deceived
me. I bear intelligence from your friends.”</p>

<p>I caught the fragment of papyrus from him, and read:</p>

<p>“All’s well. We have hitherto met with nothing to oppose
us. To-morrow night we shall be on the ground. If no addition
be made to the force within, the surprise will be complete.
Our cause itself is victory. Health to all we love!”</p>

<p>“Your mission is now done,” said I; “go on to Naphtali,
and you shall be rewarded as your activity has deserved.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Enemy of Florus</div>

<p>“No,” replied he, with the easy air of a licensed humorist;
“I have but two things to think of in this world—my time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and my money; of one of them, I have infinitely more than I
well know how to spend, and of the other infinitely less. I
expected to have killed a few days in going up to Naphtali.
But that hope has been cut off by my finding you half-way.
I will now try Florus, and get rid of a day or two with that
most worthy of men.”</p>

<p>“That I forbid,” interrupted I.</p>

<p>“Not if you will trust one whom your noble son has trusted.
I am not altogether without some dislike to the Romans myself,
nor something between contempt and hatred for Gessius
Florus.” His countenance darkened at the name. “I tell
you,” pronounced he bitterly, “that fellow’s pampered carcass
this day contains as black a mass of villainy as stains the
earth. I have an old account to settle with him.”</p>

<p>His voice quivered. “I was once no rambler, no outcast of
the land. I lived on the side of Hermon, lovely Hermon! I
was affianced to a maiden of my kindred, as sweet a flower as
ever blushed with love and joy. Our bridal day was fixed.
I went to Cæsarea-Philippi to purchase some marriage presents.
When I returned, I found nothing but women weeping,
and men furious with impotent rage. My bride was gone. A
Roman troop had surrounded her father’s house in the night
and torn her away. Wild, distracted, nay, I believe raving
mad, I searched the land. I kept life in me only that I might
recover or revenge her. I abandoned property, friends, all!
At length I made the discovery.”</p>

<p>To hide his perturbation, he turned away. “Powers of justice
and vengeance!” he murmured in a shuddering tone, “are
there no thunders for such things? She had been seen by
that hoary profligate. She was carried off by him. She
spurned his insults. He ordered her to be chained, to be
starved, to be lashed!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Slowness of Revenge</div>

<p>Tears sprang to his eyes. “She still spurned him. She
implored to die. She called upon my name in her misery.
Wretch that I was, what could I, a worm, do under the heel
of the tyrant? But I saw her at last; I made my way into
the dungeon. There she sat, pale as the stone to which she
was chained; a silent, sightless, bloodless, mindless skeleton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I called to her; she knew nothing. I pressed my lips to hers;
she never felt them. I bathed her cold hands in my tears—I
fell at her feet—I prayed to her but to pronounce one word,
to give some sign of remembrance, to look on me. She sat
like a statue; her reason was gone, gone forever!”</p>

<p>He flung himself upon the ground, and writhed and groaned
before me. To turn him from a subject of such sorrow, I
asked what he meant to do by his intercourse with Florus.</p>

<p>“To do?—not to stab him in his bed; not to poison him in
his banquet; not to smite him with that speedy death which
would be mercy—no, but to force him into ruin step by step;
to gather shame, remorse, and anguish round him, cloud on
cloud; to mix evil in his cup with such exquisite slowness
that he shall taste every drop; to strike him only so far that
he may feel the pang without being stunned; to mingle so much
of hope in his undoing that he may never enjoy the vigor of
despair; to sink him into his own Tartarus inch by inch till
every fiber has its particular agony.”</p>

<p>He yelled, suddenly rose from the ground, and rushed forward
and threaded the thickets with a swiftness that made my
pursuit in vain.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>In the Lions’ Lair</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A Beggar’s
Signals</div>

<p>The violence of the beggar’s anguish, and the strong probabilities
of his story, engrossed me so much that I at first regretted
the extraordinary flight which put it out of my power
to offer him any assistance. I returned with a feeling of disappointment
to the spot where I had left my horse, and was
riding toward the higher country, to avoid the enemy’s straggling
parties, when I heard a loud outcry. On a crag so distant
that I thought human speed could scarcely have reached
it in the time, I saw this strange being making all kinds of
signals, sometimes pointing to me, then to some object below
him, and uttering a cry which might easily be mistaken for
the howl of a wild beast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Secluded Spot</div>

<p>I reined up; it was impossible for me to ascertain whether
he were warning me of danger or apprising others of my approach.
Great stakes make man suspicious, and the prince
of Naphtali, speeding to the capture of the principal armory
of the legions, might be an object well worth a little treachery.
I rapidly forgot the beggar’s sorrows in the consideration
of his habits; decided that his harangue was a piece of
professional dexterity, probably played off every week of his
life, and that if I would not be in Roman hands before night,
I must ride in the precisely opposite direction to that which
his signals so laboriously recommended. Nothing grows with
more vigor than the doubt of human honesty. I satisfied myself
in a few moments that I was a dupe, and dashed through
thicket, over rock, forded torrent, and from the top of an
acclivity, at which even my high-mettled steed had looked
with repugnance, saw with the triumph of him who deceives
the deceiver, the increased violence of the impostor’s attitudes.
He leaped from crag to crag with the activity of a goat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
when he could do nothing else, gave the last evidence of Oriental
vexation by tearing his robes. I waved my hand to him
in contemptuous farewell, and dismounting, for the side of the
hill was almost precipitous, led my panting Arab through beds
of wild myrtle, and every lovely and sweet-smelling bloom, to
the edge of a valley that seemed made to shut out every disturbance
of man.</p>

<p>A circle of low hills, covered to the crown with foliage, surrounded
a deep space of velvet turf, kept green as the emerald
by the moisture of a pellucid lake in its center, tinged with
every color of heaven. The beauty of this sylvan spot was
enhanced by the luxuriant profusion of almond, orange, and
other trees that in every stage of production, from the bud
to the fruit, covered the little knolls below and formed a
broad belt round the lake.</p>

<p>Parched as I was by the intolerable heat, this secluded
haunt of the very spirit of freshness looked doubly lovely.
My eyes, half-blinded by the glare of the sands, and even my
mind, exhausted by the perplexities of the day, found delicious
relaxation in the verdure and dewy breath of the silent
valley. My barb, with the quick sense of animals accustomed
to the travel of the wilderness, showed her delight by playful
boundings, the prouder arching of her neck, and the brighter
glancing of her eye.</p>

<p>“Here,” thought I, as I led her slowly toward the steep descent,
“would be the very spot for the innocence that had not
tried the world, or the philosophy that had tried it and found
all vanity. Who could dream that within the borders of this
distracted land, in the very hearing, almost within the very
sight, of the last miseries that man can inflict on man, there
was a retreat which the foot of man perhaps never yet defiled,
and in which the calamities that afflict society might be as little
felt as if it were among the stars!”</p>

<p>A violent plunge of the barb put an end to my speculation.
She exhibited the wildest signs of terror, snorted and strove
to break from me; then fixing her glance keenly on the thickets
below, shook in every limb. Yet the scene was tranquillity
itself; the chameleon lay basking in the sun, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
only sound was that of the wild doves, murmuring under the
broad leaves of the palm-trees. But my mare still resisted
every effort to lead her downward; her ears were fluttering
convulsively; her eyes were starting from their sockets. I
grew peevish at the animal’s unusual obstinacy, and was
about to let her suffer thirst for the day, when I was startled
by a tremendous roar.</p>

<p>A lion stood on the summit which I had but just quitted.
He was not a dozen yards above my head, and his first
spring must have carried me to the bottom of the precipice.
The barb burst away at once. I drew the only weapon I had—a
dagger—and hopeless as escape was, grasping the tangled
weeds to sustain my footing, awaited the plunge. But the
lordly savage probably disdained so ignoble a prey, and
remained on the summit, lashing his sides with his tail and
tearing up the ground. He at length stopped suddenly,
listened, as to some approaching foot, and then with a hideous
yell, sprang over me, and was in the thicket below at a single
bound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Forest
Kings</div>

<p>The whole jungle was instantly alive; the shade which I
had fixed on for the seat of unearthly tranquillity had been
an old haunt of lions, and the mighty herd were now roused
from their noonday slumbers. Nothing could be grander or
more terrible than this disturbed majesty of the forest kings.
In every variety of savage passion, from terror to fury, they
plunged, tore, and yelled; dashed through the lake, burst
through the thicket, rushed up the hills, or stood baying and
roaring in defiance, as if against a coming invader; their numbers
were immense, for the rareness of shade and water had
gathered them from every quarter of the desert.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Savage Conflict</div>

<p>While I stood clinging to my perilous hold, and fearful of
attracting their gaze by the slightest movement, the source of
the commotion appeared, in the shape of a Roman soldier issuing,
spear in hand, through a ravine at the farther side of
the valley. He was palpably unconscious of the formidable
place into which he was entering, and the gallant clamor of
voices through the hills showed that he was followed by
others as bold and as unconscious of their danger as himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
But his career was soon closed; his horse’s feet had scarcely
touched the turf, when a lion was fixed with fang and claw
on the creature’s loins. The rider uttered a cry of horror,
and for an instant sat helplessly gazing at the open jaws behind
him. I saw the lion gathering up his flanks for a second
bound, but the soldier, a figure of gigantic strength, grasping
the nostrils of the monster with one hand, and with the other
shortening his spear, drove the steel at one resistless thrust
into the lion’s forehead. Horse, lion, and rider fell, and continued
struggling together.</p>

<p>In the next moment a mass of cavalry came thundering
down the ravine. They had broken off from their march,
through the accident of rousing a straggling lion, and followed
him in the giddy ardor of the chase. But the sight now before
them was enough to appal the boldest intrepidity. The
valley was filled with the vast herd; retreat was impossible,
for the troopers came still pouring in by the only pass, and
from the sudden descent of the glen, horse and man were
rolled head foremost among the lions; neither man nor monster
could retreat.</p>

<p>The conflict was horrible; the heavy spears of the legionaries
plunged through bone and brain; the lions, made more furious
by wounds, sprang upon the powerful horses and tore them
to the ground, or flew at the troopers’ throats, and crushed
and dragged away cuirass and buckler. The valley was a
struggling heap of human and savage battle; man, lion, and
charger writhing and rolling in agonies until their forms were
undistinguishable. The groans and cries of the legionaries,
the screams of the mangled horses, and the roars and howlings
of the lions, bleeding with sword and spear, tearing the dead,
darting up the sides of the hills in terror, and rushing down
again with the fresh thirst of gore, baffled all conception of
fury and horror. But man was the conqueror at last; the
savages, scared by the spear, and thinned in their numbers,
made a rush in one body toward the ravine, overthrew everything
in their way, and burst from the valley, awaking the

<p>The troopers, bitterly repenting their rash exploit, gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
up the remnants of their dead on litters of boughs, and leaving
many a gallant steed to feast the vultures, slowly retired
from the place of carnage.</p>

<p>The spot to which I clung made ascent or descent equally
difficult, and during their extraordinary contest I continued
embedded in the foliage, and glad to escape the eye of man
and brute alike. But the troop were now gone; beneath me lay
nothing but a scene of blood, and I began to wind my way to
the summit. A menace from below stopped me. A solitary
horseman had galloped back to give a last look to this valley
of death; he saw me climbing the hill, saw that I was not a
Roman, and in the irritation of the hour, made no scruple of
sacrificing a native to the manes of his comrades. The spear
followed his words and plowed the ground at my side. His
outcry brought back a dozen of his squadron; I found myself
about to be assailed by a general discharge. Escape on foot
was impossible, and I had no resource but to be speared, or
to descend and give myself up to the soldiery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Captured</div>

<p>It was to warn me of this hazard that the signals of my
strange companion were made. He saw the advance of the
Roman column along the plain. My suspicions of his honesty
drove me directly into their road, and the chance of turning
down the valley scarcely retarded the capture. On my first
emerging from the hills, I must have been taken. However,
my captors were in unusual ill-temper. As an Arab, too poor
to be worth plundering or being made prisoner, I should have
met only a sneer or an execration and been turned loose; but
the late disaster made the turban and haik odious, and I was
treated with the wrath due to a fellow conspirator of the
lions. To my request that I should be suffered to depart in
peace on my business, the most prompt denial was given; the
story that I told to account for my travel in the track of the
column was treated with the simplest scorn; I was pronounced
a spy, and fairly told that my head was my own only till I
gave the procurator whatever information it contained.</p>

<p>Yet I found one friend, in this evil state of my expedition.
My barb, which I had given up for lost in the desert, or torn
by the wild beasts, appeared on the heights overhanging our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
march, and by snuffing the wind, and bounding backward and
forward through the thickets, attracted general attention. I
claimed her, and the idea that the way-sore and rough-clothed
prisoner could be the master of so noble an animal, raised
scorn to its most peremptory pitch. In turn I demanded permission
to prove my right, and called the barb. The creature
heard the voice with the most obvious delight, bounded
toward me, rubbed her head against me, and by every movement
of dumb joy showed that she had found her master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Jovial
Captain</div>

<p>Still my requests for dismissal were idle; I talked to the
winds; the rear squadrons of the column were in sight; there
was no time to be lost. I was suffered to mount the barb,
but her bridle was thrown across the neck of one of the troopers’
horses, and I was marched along to death, or a tedious
captivity. My blood boiled when I thought of what was to
be done before the dawn. How miserable a proof had I
given of the vigilance and vigor that were to claim the command
of armies! I writhed in every nerve. My agitation
at length caught the eye of a corpulent old captain, whose
good-humored visage was colored by the deepest infusion of
the grape. His strong Thracian charger was a movable magazine
of the choicest Falernian; out of every crevice of his
pack-saddle and accouterments peeped the head of a flask;
and to judge by his frequent recourse to his stores, no man
was less inclined to carry his baggage for nothing. Popularity,
too, attended upon the captain, and a group of young
patricians attached to the procurator’s court were content to
abate of their rank, and ride along with the old soldier, in
consideration of his better knowledge of the grand military
science, providing for the road.</p>

<p>In the midst of some camp story, which the majority received
with peals of applause, the captain glanced upon me,
and asking “whether I was not ill,” held out his flask. I
took it, and never did I taste draught so delicious. Thirst
and hunger are the true secrets of luxury. I absolutely felt
new life rushing into me with the wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Haughtiness of a Tribune</div>

<p>“There,” said the old man, “see how the fellow’s eye
sparkles. Falernian is the doctor, after all. I have had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
other those forty years. For hard knocks, hard watches, and
hard weather, there is nothing like the true juice of the vine.
Try it again, Arab.”</p>

<p>I declined the offer in civil terms.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, “it has made the man eloquent. By
Hercules, it would make his mare speak. And now that I
look at her, she is as prettily made a creature as I have seen
in Syria; her nose would fit in a drinking-cup. What is her
price, at a word?”</p>

<p>I answered that “she was not to be sold.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, say no more about it,” replied the jovial old
man; “I know you Arabs make as much of a mare as of a
child, and I never meddle in family affairs.”</p>

<p>A haughty-looking tribune, covered with embroidery and
the other coxcombry of the court soldier, spurred his charger
between us and uttered with a sneer:</p>

<p>“What, captain, by Venus and all the Graces! giving this
beggar a lecture in philosophy or a lesson in politeness? If
you will not have the mare, I will. Dismount, slave!”</p>

<p>The officers gathered to the front, to see the progress of the
affair. I sat silent.</p>

<p>“Slave! do you hear? Dismount! You will lose nothing,
for you will steal another in the first field you come to.”</p>

<p>“I know but one race of robbers in Judea,” replied I.</p>

<p>The old captain reined up beside me, and said in a whisper:
“Friend, let him have the mare. He will pay you handsomely,
and besides, he is the nephew of the procurator. It
will not be wise in you to put him in a passion.”</p>

<p>“That fellow never shall have her, tho he were to coin these
sands into gold,” replied I.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to call us robbers?” said the tribune, with
a lowering eye.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to stop me on the high-road and take my
property from me, yet expect that I shall call you anything
else?” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Sententious rogues, those Arabs! Every soul of them
has a point, or a proverb, on his tongue,” murmured the
captain to the group of young men, who were evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
amused at seeing their unpopular companion entangled
with me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tribune’s
Rage</div>

<p>“Slave!” said the tribune fiercely, “we must have no more
of this. You have been found lurking about the camp. Will
you be hanged for a spy?”</p>

<p>“A spy!” said I—and the insult probably colored my
cheek; “a spy has no business among the Romans.”</p>

<p>“So,” observed the captain, “the Arab seems to think that
our proceedings are in general pretty palpable: slay, strip,
and burn.” He turned to the patrician tribune. “The fellow
is not worth our trouble. Shall I let him go about his business?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the tribune angrily, “it is your business to
command your troop and be silent.”</p>

<p>The old man bit his lip, and fell back to the line of his
men. My taunter reined up beside me again.</p>

<p>“Do you know, robber, that I can order you to be speared
on the spot for your lies?”</p>

<p>“No, for I have told you nothing but the truth of both of
us. Such an order, too, would only prove that men will often
bid others do what they dare not touch with a finger of their
own.”</p>

<p>The officers, offended at the treatment of their old favorite,
burst into a laugh. The coxcomb grew doubly indignant.</p>

<p>“Strip the hound!” exclaimed he to the soldiers; “it is
money that makes him insolent.”</p>

<p>“Nature has done it, at least for one of us, without the expense
of a mite,” replied I calmly.</p>

<p>“Off with his turban! Those fellows carry coin in every
fold of it.”</p>

<p>The officers looked at each other in surprise; the captain
hardly suppressed a contemptuous execration between his lips.
The very troopers hesitated.</p>

<p>“Soldiers!” said I, in the same unaltered tone, “I have no
gold in my turban. An Arab is seldom one of those—the
outside of whose head is better worth than the inside.”</p>

<p>The perfumed and curled locks of the tribune, surmounted
by a helmet, sculptured and plumed in the most extravagant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
style, caught every eye; and the shaft, slight as it was, went
home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tribune’s
Defeat</div>

<p>“I’ll pluck the robber off his horse by the beard!” exclaimed
the tribune, spurring his horse upon me and advancing
his hand.</p>

<p>I threw open my robe, grasped my dagger, and sternly
pronounced: “There is an oath in our line that the man who
touches the beard of an Arab dies.”</p>

<p>He was not prepared for the action, hesitated, and finally
wheeled from me. The old captain burst out into an involuntary
huzza.</p>

<p>“Take the beggar to the camp,” said the tribune, as he
rode away, “I hate all scoundrels”; and he glanced round
the spectators.</p>

<p>“Then,” exclaimed I, after him, as a parting blow, “you
have at least one virtue, for you can never be charged with
self-love.”</p>

<p>This woman-war made me popular on the spot. The tribune
had no sooner turned his horse’s head than the officers clustered
together in laughter. Even the iron visages of the
troopers relaxed into grim smiles. The old jocular captain
was the only one still grave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Unpleasant Interview</div>

<p>“There rides not this day under the canopy of heaven,”
murmured he, “a greater puppy than Caius Sempronius
Catulus, tribune of the thirteenth legion by his mother’s
morals and the Emperor’s taste. Why did not the coxcomb
stay at home, and show off his trappings among the supper-eaters
of the Palatine? He might have powdered his ringlets
with gold-dust, washed his hands in rose-water, and perfumed
his handkerchief with myrrh as well there as here, for he
does nothing else—except,” and he clenched the heavy hilt
of his falchion, “insult men who have seen more battles than
he has seen years, who knew better service than bowing in
courts, and the least drop of whose blood is worth all that
will ever run in his veins. But I have not done with him
yet. As for you, friend,” said he, “I am sorry to stop you
on your way; but as this affair will be magnified by that fool’s
tongue, you must be brought to the procurator. However, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
camp is only a few miles off; you will be asked a few questions,
and then left to follow your will.”</p>

<p>He little dreamed how I recoiled from that interview.</p>

<p>To shorten the time of my delay, the good-natured old man
ordered the squadron to mend their pace, and in half an hour
we saw the noon encampment of my sworn enemy, lifting its
white tops and scarlet flags among the umbrage of a forest,
deep in the valley at our feet.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Escape of Salathiel, the Magician</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Again Faces
Florus</div>

<p>The squadron drew up at the entrance of the procurator’s
tent, and with a crowd of alarmed peasants captured in the
course of the day, I was delivered over to be questioned by
this man of terror. The few minutes which passed before I
was called to take my turn were singularly painful. This
was not fear, for the instant sentence of the ax would have
been almost a relief from the hopeless and fretful thwartings
sown so thickly in my path. But to have embarked in a noble
enterprise, and to perish without use; to have arrived almost
within sight of the point of my desires, and then, without striking
a blow, to be given up to shame, stung me like a serpent.</p>

<p>My heart sprang to my lips when I heard myself called
into the presence of Florus. He was lying upon a couch,
with his never-failing cup before him, and turning over some
papers with a shaking hand. Care or conscience had made
ravages even in him since I saw him last. He was still the
same figure of excess, but his cheek was hollow; the few locks
on his head had grown a more snowy white, and the little
pampered hand was as thin and yellow as the claw of the
vulture that he so much resembled in his soul.</p>

<p>With his head scarcely lifted from the table, and with eyes
that seemed half shut, he asked whence I had come and
whither I was going. My voice, notwithstanding my attempt
to disguise it, struck his acute ear. His native keenness was
awake at once. He darted a fiery glance at me, and, striking
his hand on the table, exclaimed: “By Hercules, it is the
Jew!” My altered costume again perplexed him.</p>

<p>“Yet,” said he in soliloquy, “that fellow went to Nero,
and must have been executed. Ho! send in the tribune who
took him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
the Plunderer</div>

<p>Catulus entered, and his account of me was, luckily, contemptuous
in the extreme. I was “a notorious robber, who
had stolen a handsome horse, perfectly worthy of the stud of
the procurator.”</p>

<p>I panted with the hope of escape, and was gradually moving
to the door.</p>

<p>“Stand, slave!” cried Florus, “I have my doubts of you
still, and as the public safety admits of no mistake I have no
alternative. Tribune, order in the lictors. He must be
scourged into confession.”</p>

<p>The lictors were summoned, and I was to be torn by Roman
torturers.</p>

<p>A tumult now arose outside, and a man rushed in with the
lictors, exclaiming: “Justice, most mighty Florus! By the
majesty of Rome, and the magnanimity of the most illustrious
of governors, I call for justice against my plunderer, my undoer,
the robber of the son of El Hakim, of his most precious
treasure.”</p>

<p>Florus recognized the clamorer as an old acquaintance, and
desired him to state his complaint, and with as much brevity
as possible.</p>

<p>“Last night,” said the man, “I was the happy possessor of
a mare, fleet as the ostrich and shapely as the face of beauty.
I had intended her as a present for the most illustrious of
procurators, the great Florus, whom the gods long preserve!
In the hour of my rest, the spoiler came, noiseless as the fall
of the turtle’s feather, cruel as the viper’s tooth. When I
arose the mare was gone. I was in distraction. I tore my
beard; I beat my head upon the ground; I cursed the robber
wherever he went, to the sun-rising or the sun-setting, to the
mountains or the valleys. But fortune sits on the banner of
my lord the procurator, and I came for hope of his conquering
feet. In passing through the camp, what did I see but my
treasure, the delight of my eyes, the drier up of my tears! I
have come to claim justice and the restoration of my mare,
that I may have the happiness to present her to the most renowned
of mankind.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Mare’s Wildness</div>

<p>I had been occupied with the thought whether I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
burst through the lictors or rush on the procurator. But the
length and loudness of this outcry engrossed every one. The
orator was my friend the beggar! He pointed fiercely to me.
If looks could kill, he would not have survived the look that
I gave the traitor in return.</p>

<p>“There,” said Florus, “is your plunderer. Sabat, have
you ever seen him before?”</p>

<p>The beggar strode insolently toward me.</p>

<p>“Seen him before! aye, a hundred times. What! Ben
Ammon, the most notorious thief from the Nile to the Jordan!
My lord, every child knows him. Ha, by the gods of my
fathers, by my mother’s bosom, by shaft and by shield, he
has stolen more horses within the last twenty years than
would remount all the cavalry from Beersheba to Damascus!
It was but last night that, as I was leading my mare, the gem
of my eyes, my pearl——”</p>

<p>I now began to perceive the value of my eloquent friend’s
interposition.</p>

<p>“An Arab horse-thief! That alters the case,” said the procurator.
“Ho! did you not say that the mare was intended
for me? Lictor, go and bring this wonder to the door.”</p>

<p>The voluble son of El Hakim followed the lictor, and returned,
crying out more furiously than before against me.
His “pearl, the delight of his eyes, was spoiled—was utterly
unmanagable. I had put some of my villainous enchantments
upon her, for which I was notorious.”</p>

<p>The procurator’s curiosity was excited; he rose and went
to take a view of the enchanted animal. I followed, and certainly
nothing could be more singular than the restiveness
which the son of El Hakim contrived to make her exhibit.
She plunged, she bounded, bit, reared, and flung out her heels
in all directions. Every attempt to lead or mount her was
foiled in the most complete yet most ludicrous manner. The
young cavalry officers came from all sides, and could not be
restrained from boisterous laughter, even by the presence of
the procurator. Florus himself at last became among the
loudest. Even I, accustomed as I was to daring horsemanship,
was surprised at the eccentric agility of this unlucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
rider. He was alternately on the animal’s back and under her
feet; he sprang upon her from behind, he sprang over her
head, he stood upon the saddle, but all in vain; he had
scarcely touched her when she threw him up in the air again,
amid the perpetual roar of the soldiery.</p>

<p>At length, with a look of dire disappointment, he gave up
the task, and, as scarcely able to drag his limbs along, prostrated
himself before Florus, praying that he would order the
Arab thief to unsay the spells that had turned “the gentlest
mare in the world into a wild beast.” The consent was given
with a haughty nod, and I advanced to play my part in a performance,
the object of which I had no conception. The orator
delivered the barb to me with a look so expressive of cunning,
sport, and triumph, that perplexed as I was, I could
not avoid a smile.</p>

<p>My experiment was rapidly made. The mare knew me,
and was tractable at once. This only confirmed the charge
of my necromancy. But the son of El Hakim professed himself
altogether dissatisfied with so expeditious a process, and
demanded that I should go through the regular steps of the
art. In the midst of the fiercest reprobation of my unhallowed
dealings, a whisper from him put me in possession of his mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Accuser’s
Warning</div>

<p>I now went through the process used by the traveling jugglers,
and if the deepest attention of an audience could reward
my talents, mine received unexampled reward. My gazings
on the sky, whisperings in the barb’s ear, grotesque figures
traced on the sand, wild gestures and mysterious jargon,
thoroughly absorbed the intellects of the honest legionaries.
If I had been content with fame, I might have spread my
reputation through the Roman camps as a conjurer of the first
magnitude. I was, however, beginning to be weary of my
exhibition, and longed for the signal, when Sabat approached,
and loudly testifying that I had clearly performed my task,
threw the bridle over the animal’s head and whispered,
“Now!”</p>

<p>My heart panted; my hand was on the mane; I glanced
round to see that all was safe, before I gave the spring, when
Florus screamed out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lesson in
Horse-Stealing</div>

<p>“The Jew! by Tartarus, it is the Jew himself. Drag down
the circumcised dog.”</p>

<p>With cavalry on every side of me, forcible escape was out
of the question.</p>

<p>“Undone, undone!” were the words of my wild friend, as
he passed me. And when I saw him once more in the most
earnest conversation with Florus, I concluded that the discovery
was complete. I was in utter despair. I stood sullenly
waiting the worst, and gave an internal curse to the
more than malevolence of fortune.</p>

<p>The conversation continued so long that the impatience of
those around me began to break out.</p>

<p>“On what possible subject can the procurator suffer that
mad fellow to have so long an audience?” said a young patrician.</p>

<p>“On every possible subject, I should conceive, from the
length of the conference,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Florus knows his man,” said a third; “that mad fellow is
a regular spy, and receives more of the Emperor’s coin in a
month than we do in a year.”</p>

<p>The tribune now broke into the circle, and with a look of
supreme scorn, affectedly exclaimed: “Come, knight of the
desert, sovereign of the sands, let us have a specimen of your
calling. Stand back, officers; this egg of Ishmael is to quit
plunder so soon that he would probably like to die as he
lived—in the exercise of his trade. Here, slave, show us the
most approved method of getting possession of another man’s
horse.”</p>

<p>I stood in indignant silence. The tribune threatened. A
thought struck me; I bowed to the command, let the barb
loose, and proceeded according to the theory of horse-stealing.
I approached noiselessly, gesticulated, made mystic movements,
and gibbered witchcraft as before. The animal, with
natural docility, suffered my experiments. I continued urging
her toward the thinner side of the circle.</p>

<p>“Now, noble Romans,” said I, “look carefully to the next
spell, for it is the triumph of the art.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tribune Outdone</div>

<p>Curiosity was in every countenance. I made a genuflexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to the four points of the compass, devoted a gesture of peculiar
solemnity to the procurator’s tent, and while all eyes
were drawn in that direction, sprang on the barb’s back and
was gone like an arrow.</p>

<p>I heard a clamor of surprise, mingled with outrageous
laughter, and looking round, saw the whole crowd of the
loose riders of the encampment in full pursuit up the hill.
Florus was at his tent door, pointing toward me with furious
gestures. The trumpets were calling, the cavalry mounting;
I had roused the whole activity of the little army.</p>

<p>The slope of the valley was long and steep, and the heavy
horsemanship of the legionaries, who were perhaps not very
anxious for my capture, soon threw them out. A little knot
of the more zealous alone kept up a pursuit, from which I had
no fears. An abrupt rock in the middle of the ascent at
length hid them from me. To gain a last view of the camp,
I doubled round the rock and saw, a few yards below me, the
tribune, with his horse completely blown. I owed him a debt,
which I had determined to discharge at the earliest possible
time, partly on my own account, and partly on that of the
old captain. I darted upon him. He was all astonishment;
a single buffet from my naked hand knocked the helpless
taunter off his charger.</p>

<p>“Tribune,” cried I, as he lay upon the ground, “you have
had one specimen of my art to-day, now you shall have another.
Learn in future to respect an Arab.”</p>

<p>I caught his horse’s bridle, gave the animal a lash, and we
bounded away together. The scene was visible to the whole
camp; the troopers, who had reined up on the declivity, gave
a roar of merriment, and I heard the old corpulent captain’s
laugh above it all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Contents
of the
Saddle-Bag</div>

<p>I had escaped, but the delay was ruinous. The sun sank
when I reached the brow of the mountain, and Masada lay
many a weary mile forward. I cast off the tribune’s horse,
thus giving his insolent master evidence that I did not understand
the main point of my trade, and stood pondering to
what point of the mighty ridge that rose blue along the horizon
I should turn, when, in the plunge of the horse as he felt
himself at liberty, his saddle came to the ground. The possibility
of its containing reports of the state of the enemy led
me to examine its pockets; they were stuffed with letters
worthy of the highest circles of Italian high life; the ill-spelled
registers of an existence at a loss how to lose its time;
of libertinism sick of indulgence, and of pecuniary embarrassment
driven to the most hopeless and whimsical resources.</p>

<p>A glance at a few of those epistles was enough, and I scattered
into the air the reputations of half the high-born maids
and matrons of Rome; but as I was turning away with an instinctive
exclamation of scorn at this compendium of patrician
life, my eye was caught by a letter addressed to the governor
of Masada. In opening it, I committed no violation of diplomacy,
for it held no secret other than an angry remission
of his allegiance by some wearied fair one, who announced
her intended marriage with the tribune.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Distant
Sound
of Strife</div>

<p>My revenge was thus to go further than my intent, for I
deprived him of the personal triumph of delivering this calamitous
despatch to his rival. Yet, on second thought,
conceiving that some cipher might lurk under its absurdity, I
secured the paper, and giving the rein, left the whole secret
correspondence of debt, libel, and love to the delight of mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
I flew along; my indefatigable barb, as if she felt
her master’s anxieties, put forth double speed. But I had
yet a fearful distance to traverse. The night came, but I
had no time to think of rest or shelter. I pushed on. The
wind rose and wrapt me in whirls of sand. I heard the roar
of waters. The ground became fractured, and full of the
loose fragments that fall from rocky hills. I found that I
was at the foot of the ridge and had lost my way. In this
embarrassment I trusted to the sagacity of my steed. But
thirst led her directly to one of the mountain torrents, and the
phosphoric gleam of the waters alone saved us both from a
plunge over a precipice, deep enough to extinguish every appetite
and ambition in the round of this bustling world.</p>

<p>To find a passage or an escape, I alighted. The torrent
bellowed before me. A wall of rock rose on the opposite
side. After long climbings and descents, I found that I had
descended too deep to return. Oh, how I longed for the trace
of man, for the feeblest light that ever twinkled from the cottage
window! I felt the plague of helplessness. To attempt
the torrent was impossible. To linger where I stood till
dawn was misery.</p>

<p>What would be going on meanwhile? Perhaps, at the
very time while I was standing in wretched doubt, imprisoned
among those pestilent cliffs, the deed was doing. Constantius
was, with ineffectual gallantry, assaulting the fortress; my
brave kinsmen were sacrificing their lives under the Roman
spears, and I was not there!</p>

<p>A fitful sound came mingling with the roar of the cataract;
it swelled, and vanished like the rushings of the gale. A
trumpet sounded, but so feebly that nothing but the keenness
of an ear straining to catch the slightest sound could have
distinguished it. I heard remote shouts; they deepened; the
echo of trumpets followed.</p>

<p>“The assault has begun!” I thought. “The work of glory
and of death was doing. Every instant cost a life. The
hailstones that bruised me were not thicker than the arrows
that were then smiting down my people. Yet there was I,
like a wolf in the pitfall!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In the
Torrent</div>

<p>Even where the combat was being fought, baffled my conception.
It might be in the clouds or underground, on the
opposite side of the black ridge before me, or many a league
beyond the reach of my exhausted limbs and drooping steed;
all was darkness to the eye and to the mind.</p>

<p>A light flashed down a ravine leading into the heart of the
mountains; another and another blazed. Masada stood upon
the mountain’s brow.</p>

<p>I instantly plunged into the torrent—was beaten down by
the billows—was swept along through narrow channels of
rock, until, half-suffocated, I was hurled up against the opposite
cliff. Wet and weary, I less climbed than tore my
way upward. But the torrent had borne me far below the
ravine. Before me was a gigantic rampart of rock. But the
time was flying. I dragged myself up to the face of the
precipice by the chance brushwood. I swung from point to
point by a few projecting branches that broke away almost
in my grasp, until, with my hands excoriated, my limbs stiff
and bleeding, and my head reeling, I reached the pinnacle.</p>

<p>Was I under the dominion of a spell? Was the power of
some fiend raised to mock me? All was darkness as far as
the eye could pierce; the heaviest veil of midnight hung upon
the earth. There was utter silence. Not the slightest sound
reached the ear.</p>

<p>For a while, the thought of some strange illusion was paramount;
then came the frightful idea that the illusion was in
myself; that in the effort to gain the ascent, I had strained
eye and ear until I could neither hear nor see; that I was
still within sight and sound of battle, but insensible to the
impressions of the external world forever. Immortality under
this exclusion! A deathlessness of the deaf and blind!
The thought struck me with a force inconceivable by all minds
but one sentenced like mine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius Tells of the Attack</div>

<p>In my despair I cried aloud. A flood of joy rushed into
my heart when I heard my voice answered, tho it was
but by the neigh of my barb below, which probably felt itself
as ill-placed as its master. I now used my ear as the guide,
and cautiously descending the farther side of the ridge was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
soon on comparatively level ground, the remnant of a forest.
My foot struck against a human body; I spoke; the answer
was a groan, and an entreaty that I should bear a small
packet, which was put into my hands, “to the prince of
Naphtali!” In alarm and astonishment, I raised the sufferer,
gave him some water from my flask, and after many an effort,
in which I thought that life would depart every moment, he
told me that “he was the unfortunate leader of the assault of
Masada.” Constantius lay in my arms!</p>

<p>“Where I am,” said he, as he slowly recovered his senses,
“how I came here, or anything but that we are undone, I
can not conceive. My last recollection was of fixing a ladder
to the inner rampart. We had made our way good so far
without loss. The garrison was weakened by detachments
sent out to plunder. I attacked at midnight. To surprise
a Roman fortress was, I well knew, next to impossible; and
no man ever found a Roman garrison without bravery. But
our bold fellows did wonders. Everything was driven from
the first rampart; we made more prisoners than we knew
what to do with, and in the midst of all kinds of resistance,
we laid our ladders to the second wall. But the garrison
were still too strong for us. Our easy conquest of the first
line might have been a snare, for the battlements before us
exhibited an overwhelming force. We fought on, but the
ladders were broken with showers of stones from the engines.
The business looked desperate, but I had made up my mind
not to go back, after having once got in; and rallying the
men, I carried a ladder through a storm of lances and arrows,
to the foot of the main tower. I was bravely followed, and
we were within grasp of the battlement when I saw a cohort
rush out from a sally-port below. This was fatal; the foot
of the rampart was cleared at once; the ladders were flung
down; and I suppose it is owing to the ill-judged fidelity of
some of my followers that I am unfortunate enough to find
myself here and alive.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Friend, the Beggar</div>

<p>During the endless hours of this miserable night, I labored
with scarcely a hope to keep life in my heroic son. My coming
had saved him. The exposure and his wounds must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
destroyed him before morning. We consulted as to our next
course. I suggested the possibility of gaining the fortress by
a renewal of the attack, while the garrison was unprepared,
or perhaps indulging in carousal after success. The necessity
of some attempt was strongly in my mind, and I expressed my
determination to run the hazard, if I could find where the
remnant of our troop had taken refuge. But this was the
difficulty. Signals of any kind must rouse the vigilance of
the Romans. The fortress was above our heads, and to collect
the men during the night was impossible.</p>

<p>While I watched the restless tossings of Constantius, a light
stole along the ground at a distance. My first idea was that
a Roman patrol was coming to extinguish our last remains of
hope. But the light was soon perceived to be in the hand of
some one cautious of discovery. To keep its bearer at a distance,
I followed the track and grasped him.</p>

<p>“I surrender,” said the captive, perfectly at his ease;
“long life to the Emperor!” He lifted the lamp to my face
and burst into laughter. “May I have a Roman falchion
through me,” said he, “but I think we were born under the
same planet. By all the food that has entered my lips this
day, I took your highness for a thief, and, pardon the word,
for a Roman one. I have been running after you the whole
day and night.”</p>

<p>He confined to talk and writhe, with a kind of mad merriment.
I could not obtain an answer to my questions, of
what led him there, how he could guide us out of the forest,
or what news he brought from the procurator. He less
walked than danced before me through the thickets, as our
scene with Florus recurred to his fantastic mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Physician</div>

<p>“Never was trick so capital as your escape,” he exclaimed.
“I would have given an eye or an arm, things rather an impediment
to a beggar, I allow; but it would have been worth
a kingdom to see, as I saw, the faces of the whole camp, procurator,
officers, troopers, and all, down to the horse-boys,
on your slipping through their fingers in such first-rate style.
I have done clever things in my time, but never, no never, shall
I equal that way of making five thousand men at once look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
like five thousand fools. I own I thought that you would do
something brilliant, and it was for that purpose that I tried
to draw off the eye of that scoundrel Florus, for, sot as he is,
there are not ten in Palestine keener in all points where
roguery is concerned. I caught hold of his robe, told him a
ready lie of the largest size about a discovery of coin in Jerusalem,
and while he was nibbling at the bait I heard the uproar.
You were off; I could not help laughing in his illustrious
face. He kicked me from him, and foaming with rage,
ordered every man and horse out after your highness. But I
saw at a glance that you had the game in your own hands.
You skimmed away like a bird; an eagle could not have got up
that long hill in finer condition. Away you went, bounding
from steep to steep, like a stone from a sling; you cut the
air like a shaft. I have seen many a mare in my time, but as
for the equal of yours—why a pair of wings would be of no
use to her. She is a paragon, a bird of paradise, an ostrich
on four legs, a——”</p>

<p>I checked his volubility and led him to the rough bedside
of Constantius. I could not have found a better auxiliary.
He knew every application used in the medicine of the time,
and, to give him credit on his own showing, all diseases found
in him an enemy worth all the doctors of Asia.</p>

<p>“He had traveled for his knowledge; he had fought with
death from the Nile to the Ganges, and could swear that the
sharks and crocodiles owed him a grudge throughout the
world. He had cured rajahs and satraps till he made himself
unpopular in every court where men looked for vacancies;
had kept rich old men out of their graves until there was a
general conspiracy of heirs to drive him out of the country;
and had poured life into so many dying husbands that the
women made a universal combination against his own.”</p>

<p>This flow of panegyric, however, did not impede his present
services. He applied his herbs and bandages with professional
dexterity, and kindling a fire, prepared some food,
which went further to cheer the patient than even his medicine.
He still talked away like one to whom words were a
necessary escape for his surcharge of animal spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Leech’s
Skill</div>

<p>“He knew everything in physic. He had studied in Egypt,
and could compound the true essential extract of mummy with
any man that wore a beard, from the Cataracts to the bottom
of the Delta. He once walked to the Mountains of the Moon
to learn the secret of powdered chrysolite. On the Himalaya
he picked up his knowledge of the bezoar, and a year’s
march through sands and snows rewarded him at once with a
bag of the ginseng, most marvelous of roots, and the sight of
the wall of China, most endless of walls.”</p>

<p>How he stooped to veil this accumulation of knowledge in
rags, he did not condescend to explain. But his skill, so far,
was certainly admirable, and my brave Constantius recovered
with a suddenness that surprised me. With his strength his
hopes returned.</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed he, waking from a refreshing sleep, “that
I were once again at the foot of the rampart with the ladder
in my hand!”</p>

<p>“By my father’s beard,” replied the leech, “you are much
better where you are; for observe, tho I can go further than
any doctor between the four rivers, yet I never professed
to cure the dead. Take Masada by scale! Ha! ha! take the
clouds by scale! You would have found three walls within
the one to which they decoyed you. Herod was the prince of
builders, and could have so built as to have kept out everything,
except the champion that carries no arms but a
scythe.”</p>

<p>“Then you know Masada?” interrupted I eagerly.</p>

<p>“Know it, yes; every loophole, window, door—aye, and
dungeon—from one end of it to the other.”</p>

<p>Still, my escape from the camp was so congenial to his
ideas of pleasantry that it mingled with all his topics. War
and politics went for nothing compared with the adroitness
of eluding Roman insolence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Knowledge of Masada</div>

<p>“By Jove!” said he, “when I played my tricks with that
pearl of pearls, that supreme of horseflesh, your barb, I was
clumsy; I played the clown; you beat me hollow; it was
matchless; it was my purse in prospect of your generosity to
its emptiness this night”—he made a profound obeisance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
“to see those fellows panting up the hill after you, nearly
killed me.”</p>

<p>“But the fortress?”</p>

<p>“Oh! as to the fortress, the notion of attacking it was madness.
I had my doubts of your intention, and broke loose
from the camp to give you the benefit of my advice. But
the tribune; ha, ha! never was coxcomb so rightly served.
You won the heart of the whole legion by the single blow that
spared him the trouble of sitting his horse. The troopers could
not keep their saddles for laughing; and as for the fat old captain,
I was only afraid that he would roar himself out of the
world. I owed my escape partly to him, and his last words
were: ‘Rascal, if you ever fall in with the Arab, whom I suspect
to be as pleasant a rogue as yourself, tell him that I wish
I had a dozen such in my squadron.’”</p>

<p>“But is there any possibility of knowing the present state
of the garrison?”</p>

<p>“Aye, there is the misfortune. Yesterday I could have got
in, and got out again, like a wild-cat. But, after this night’s
visit, it is not too much to suppose that they may be a little
more select in their hospitality. The governor has a slight
correspondence of his own to carry on; a trifle in the way of
trade; I had the honor to be smuggler extraordinary to his
Mightiness, and, as in state secrets everything ought to be
kept from the vulgar, my path in and out was by a portcullis,
far enough from gates and sentinels, through which portcullis
I should have shown you the way, if the attack had waited
for me a few hours longer. That chance is of course cut off
now. But see, yonder comes the morning.”</p>

<p>“Then we must move, or have the garrison on us.”</p>

<p>“I forbid that maneuver,” interrupted the fellow, with
easy audacity.</p>

<p>Constantius and I, in equal surprise, bade him be silent.
Yet the quietness with which he took the rebuke propitiated
me, and I asked his reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Gains an Ally</div>

<p>“Nothing more than that if you stir you are ruined. The
hare is safest near the kennel. The outlaw sleeps sounder in
the magistrate’s stable than he ever slept in his den. I once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
escaped hanging by coolly walking into a jail. There stands
Masada!” and he pointed to what looked to me a heap of
black clouds gathered on the mountain’s brow.</p>

<p>“Not a soul that you have left alive there will dream of
your being within a stone’s throw. The copse is thick enough
to hide a man from everything but a creditor, an evil conscience,
or a wife; stir out of it, and they are on your heels.
I dislike them so heartily that I hope never to have the honor
of their attendance. But you are not mad enough to think
of trying them again?”</p>

<p>“Mad fellow!” I exclaimed, “you forget in whose presence
you are.”</p>

<p>He continued making some new arrangement of the
bandages on his patient’s wounds, and without taking the
slightest notice of my displeasure, cheered his work with a
song.</p>

<p>“Mad or wise,” said I in soliloquy, “I shall lie in the ditch
of that fortress, or in its citadel, before next sunrise.”</p>

<p>“You may lie in both,” said the beggar, pursuing his occupation
and his song. “Mad! Why not?—all the world is in
the same way. The Emperor is mad enough to stay where
men have hands and knives. His people are mad enough to
let their throats be cut by him. Florus is mad enough
to sleep another night in Palestine. You are mad enough to
attack his garrison; and I—am mad enough to go along with
you.”</p>

<p>“You are a singular being. But will you hazard your neck
for nothing?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Importance of a Letter</div>

<p>“Custom makes everything easy,” observed he, spanning
his muscular neck with his hand; “I have been so many
years within sight of the cord, and all other expeditious
modes of paying the only debt I ever intend to pay, and that
only because it is the last, that I care as little about the venture
as any broken gambler about his last coin. Well then,
my plan is this: I must get into the town; you must gather
your troop without noise and be ready for my signal, a light
from one of the towers. A false attack must be made on the
gates, a true attack must be made by the portcullis, which, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
it be not stopped up, I will unlock; and your highness may
eat your next supper off the governor’s plate. There’s a plan
for you! I should have been a general. But merit—aye,
there’s the rub—merit is like the camel’s lading: it stops him
at the gate, while the empty slip in. It is like putting wings
upon one’s shoulders, when the race is to be run upon the
ground. Too much brain in a man is like too much bend in
a bow; the bow either breaks, or sends the arrow a mile beyond
the mark. Genius, my prince, is——”</p>

<p>I interrupted the general in his progress into the philosopher,
and demanded whether the renewed vigilance of the fortress
would not require some additional expedient for his
entry. He struck his forehead; the thought came, as the
flint gives its spark, and he produced a highly ornamented
tablet.</p>

<p>“This,” said he, “I ought to employ in your service, for
if you had not knocked down the tribune I could never
have picked it up. In making my run over the mountain, I
struck upon his correspondence. Oh! the curse of curiosity!
if I had not stopped to delight myself with the whole scandal
of Rome, I should have been here in time. But I lingered,
lost an hour in laughing, and when I set out in the dusk lost
my way, for the first time in my life. Before setting off,
however, I wrote a letter, ridiculing Florus in all points, burlesquing
the people about him, scoffing at everybody in the
most heroic style; and having subscribed the name of the
unlucky tribune, addressed it to one of the most notorious
personages in all Italy, and placed it where it is sure to be
seen, and as sure to be carried to the most noble of procurators.
Now could I not begin a correspondence with the governor,
and act the courier myself? Yet, to hit upon the subject——”
He paused.</p>

<p>The letter that I had found occurred to me. I showed it to
our adroit friend. He was in ecstasies. He kissed it over and
over, and played some of those antics which had already made
me almost half doubt his sanity. He flung away the tablet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Beggar’s Confidence</div>

<p>“Go,” said he; “fiction is a fine thing in its way. But give

bait will carry the largest hook. Aye, this is the letter for us;
it has the sincerity of the sex, when they are determined to
jilt a man; its abuse will cover me from top to toe with the
cloak of a true ambassador.”</p>

<p>“Let the potentate by whom they are sent settle that affair

<span class="smaller"><i>Prisoners in a Labyrinth</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Before the
Fortress</div>

<p>The day passed anxiously, for every sound of the huge
fortress was heard in the thicket. The creaking of machines,
brought up to the walls against future assault; the rattling of
hammers; the rolling of wagons loaded with materials for the
repair of the night’s damage; the calls of trumpet and clarion,
and the march of patrols, rang perpetually in our ears. The
depth of the copse justified the beggar’s generalship, and the
son of El Hakim proved himself a master of the art of castrametation.
Nothing could exceed his alertness in threading
the mazes of this dwarf forest, where a wolf could scarcely
have made progress and where a lynx would have required
all his eyes.</p>

<p>On my asking how he contrived to find his way through this
labyrinth, he told me, that “for making one’s way in woods
and elsewhere, there was nothing like a familiarity with
smuggling and affairs of state.”</p>

<p>“The man,” continued he, “who has driven a trade in
everything, from pearls to pistachios, without leave of the
customs, can not be much puzzled by thickets; and the man
who has contrived to climb into confidence at court must have
had a talent for keeping his feet in the most slippery spots, or
he never could have mounted the back stairs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sound of the Enemy</div>

<p>He collected the scattered troop, of whom but few had
fallen, tho nearly one half were made prisoners; they were
eager to attempt the rampart again, all boldly attributing
their failure to accident, and all thirsting alike for the
rescue of their comrades and for revenge. The letter was
given to our emissary, and I ascended the loftiest of the
mountain pinnacles, to examine for myself the nature of the
ground. From my height the view was complete; the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
interior of the fortress lay open, and in the same glance I saw
the grandeur of design which Greek taste could stamp even
upon the strength of military architecture, and the utter hopelessness
of any direct assault upon Masada<a name="ENanchor_32" id="ENanchor_32"></a><a href="#Endnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> by less than an
army.</p>

<p>Who but he that has actually been in the same situation,
can conceive the feelings with which I gazed! Below me was
the spot in which a few hours must see me conqueror or nothing!
On that battlement I might, before another morn, be
stretched in blood! On that tower I might be fixed a horrid
spectacle! Nature is irresistible, and her workings, for
a while, overpowered even the belief in my mysterious sentence.
The thought has always terribly returned, but the
moment of energy has ever extinguished it; the hurrying and
swelling current of my heart rolled over it, as the winter torrent
rushes over the tomb on its brink. The melancholy
memorial was there, sure to reappear with the first subsiding,
but lost while the flood of feeling whirled along. Every
group of soldiery that sang, or gamed, or gazed, along the
ramparts, under the bright and quiet day which followed so
fearful a night; every archer pacing on his tower; every
change of the guard; every entering courier, was visible to
me, and all were objects of keen interest.</p>

<p>At length my courier came. I saw his approach from a pass
of the mountains at the remotest point from our cover, his
well-contrived exhaustion, and the fearless impudence with
which he beguiled the sulky guard at the gate, and stalked
before the centurion by whom he was brought to the governor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman
Reenforcement</div>

<p>With what eyes of impatience I now watched the sun. As
the hour of fate approached, the fever of the mind grew. To
defer the attack beyond the night was to abandon it, for by
morn the troops under Florus must reach Masada. Yet a
strange sensation, a chilliness of heart sometimes came on me,
in which my hands were as feeble as an infant’s. Nothing
tries the soul more deeply than this concentration of its fortunes
into a few moments. The man sees himself standing
on the edge of a precipice, down which there is no second
step. But the thought of returning errandless and humiliated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and this, too, from my first enterprise, was intolerable.
I made my decision.</p>

<p>From that instant I breathed freely, my strength returned,
hope glowed in my bosom, and clinging to the granite spire
of the mountain, I looked down upon the haughty stronghold,
like its evil genius descending from the clouds. The sun
touched the western ridge. A horseman came at full speed
across the plain at its foot and entered the fortress. He evidently
brought news of importance, for the troops were hurried
under arms, flags hoisted on the ramparts, and the walls
lined with archers. All was military bustle.</p>

<p>My first conception was, that my emissary had betrayed us,
and that we were about to be attacked. I plunged from the
pinnacle, and was following the windings of the goat track to
our lair, when I saw the rising of a cloud of dust in the distance.
It moved with rapidity, and soon developed its contents.
Intelligence of the assault had reached Florus. His
sagacity saw what perils turned on the loss of the fortress;
he shook off his indolence, and came without delay to its
succor. Banners, helmets, and scarlet cloaks poured across
the plain. A torrent of brass, burning and flashing in the
sunbeam, continued to roll down the defile, and before the
evening star glittered the whole cavalry of the fifteenth legion
was trampling over the drawbridge of Masada. Here was the
death-blow. My enterprise was henceforth tenfold more hopeless;
but with me the time for prudence was past. If the reenforcement
had arrived but an hour before, I should probably
have given up the attempt in despair. But my mind was now
fixed; I had made an internal vow, and if the whole host of
Rome was crowded within the walls beneath me, I should
have hazarded the assault.</p>

<p>I descended, found my troop collected, and, to my alarm
and vexation, Constantius, enfeebled as he was, obstinately
determined to assault the rampart again. With the daring of
his enthusiastic heart he told me that unless I suffered him to
attempt the retrieval of his defeat, he felt it impossible to
survive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the Subterranean</div>

<p>“Shame and grief,” said he, “are as deadly as the sword,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

the family whom I honor, unless I can return with the consciousness
of having at least deserved to be successful.”</p>

<p>Against this I reasoned, but reasoned in vain. We finally
divided our followers. I gave him the attack of the rampart,
which was to be the place of his triumph or his grave; flung
myself into his embrace, and listened to his parting steps
with a heart throbbing at every tread. I then moved round
the foot of the mountain toward the secret passage. The
night fell as dark as we could wish. I waited impatiently
for the signal, a light from the walls. Yet no signal twinkled
from wall or tower, and I began to distrust again; but while
I lingered, a shout told me that Constantius was already engaged.</p>

<p>“Let what will, come,” exclaimed I; “onward!”</p>

<p>We scrambled up the face of the rock, and at length found
the entrance of the subterranean. It was so narrow that even
in the daytime it must have been invisible from below. A
low iron door a few yards within the fissure was the first obstacle.
To beat it down might alarm the garrison. The passage
only allowed us to advance one by one. I led the way,
hatchet in hand. A few blows broke the stones round the
lock; the door gave way, and we all crept in. In this manner
we wound along for a distance which I began to think
endless. The passage was singularly toilsome. We descended
steep paths, in which it was with the utmost difficulty
that we could keep our feet; we heard the rush of waters
through the darkness; blasts of bitter wind swept against us;
the thick and heavy air that closed round us after them almost
impeded our breathing; and from time to time sulfurous
vapors gave the fearful impression that we had lost our way
and were actually in the bowels of a burning mine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Dazzling Sight</div>

<p>My hunters still held on, but the mere fatigue of struggling
through this poisoned atmosphere was fast exhausting their
courage. I cheered them with what hopes I could, but never
was my imagination more barren. I heard, at every step I
took, fewer feet following me. The pestilential air was beginning
to act even upon myself; but the great stake was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
playing above, and onward I must go. I dared not speak
louder than a whisper; soon no whisper responded to mine.
I tottered on, until overpowered by the feeling that our sacrifice
was in vain, a sensation like that of a sickly propensity
to sleep bound up my faculties; whether I slept or
fainted, I for a time lost all recollection.</p>

<p>A roar, like thunder overhead, roused me. A sight, the
most superb, burst on my dazzled eyes; a roof of seeming gold,
arched so high that even its splendor was partially dimmed;
walls of apparent diamond, pillared with a thousand columns
of every precious gem; whole shafts of emerald; pavilions of
jasper; a floor, as far as the glance could pierce, studded with
amethyst and ruby; apparent treasures, to which the accumulated
spoils of the Greek or the Persian were nothing; the
finest devices of the most exquisite art, mingled with the most
colossal forms which wealth could wear; opulence in its massive
and negligent grandeur; opulence in its delicate and almost
spiritualized beauty, were before me. A slender flame
burning at the foot of an idol lighted up this stupendous
temple.</p>

<p>I was alone, but the orifice by which I had entered was
visible; the light shot far down into it, and I soon brought
forward the greater number of my troop. All were equally
wrapt in wonder, and the superstitious feelings, which the
presence of the Roman and Syrian idolaters had partially generated
even in the Jewish mind, began to startle those brave
men.</p>

<p>“We had, perhaps, come into forbidden ground; the gods
of the earth, whether gods or demons, were powerful, and
we stood in the violated center of the mountain.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entrapped</div>

<p>For the first time, I found the failure of my influence. A
few adhered to me, but the majority calmly declared that,
however fearless of man, they dared go no farther. I threw
myself on the ground before the entrance of the cavern, and
desired them to consummate their crime by trampling on their
leader. But they were determined to retire. I taunted them,
I adjured them, I poured out the most vehement reproaches.
They stepped over me as I lay at the mouth of the fissure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and at length one and all left me to cry out in my dazzling
solitude against the treachery of human faith and the
emptiness of human wishes.</p>

<p>The roar again rolled above; I heard distant shouts and
trumpets. In the sudden and desperate consciousness that
all was now to be gained or lost, I rushed after the fugitives,
to force them back. I plunged into the darkness, and grasped
the first figure that I could overtake. My hand fell on the
iron cuirass of a Roman! my blood ran chill. “Were we
betrayed—decoyed into the bowels of the mountain to be massacred?”</p>

<p>The figure started from me. I gave a blind blow of the ax,
and heard it crush through his helmet. The man fell at my
feet. I wildly demanded, “How he came there, and how we
might make our way into the light?”</p>

<p>“You are undone,” said he faintly. “Your spy was seized
by the procurator. Your attack was known, and the door of
the subterranean left unguarded to entrap you. This passage
was the entrance to a former mine, and in the mine is your
grave.”</p>

<p>The voice sank; he groaned, and was no more.</p>

<p>His words were soon confirmed by the hurried return of my
men. They had found the passage obstructed by a portcullis,
dropped since their entrance. Torches were seen through the
fissures above, and the sound of arms rattled round us. The
ambush was complete.</p>

<p>“Now,” said I, “we have but one thing for it—the sword,
first for our enemy, last for ourselves. If we must die, let us
not die by Roman halters.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Dungeon</div>

<p>One and all, we rushed back into the mine. But we had
now no leisure to look upon the beauty of those spars and
crystals which under the light of the altar glittered and
blushed with such gem-like radiance. From that altar now
rose a pyramid of fire; piles of faggots, continually poured
from a grating above, fed the blaze to intolerable fierceness.
Smoke filled the mine. To escape was beyond hope. The
single orifice had been already tried. Around us was a solid
wall as old as the world. It was already heating with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
blaze; our feet shrank from the floor. The flame, shooting
in a thousand spires, coiled and sprang against the roof, the
walls, and the ground. To remain where we were, was to be
burned to cinders. The catastrophe was inevitable.</p>

<p>In the madness of pain, I made a furious bound into the
column of fire. All followed, for death was certain, and the
sooner it came the better. With unspeakable feelings I saw,
at the back of the mound of stone on which the faggots
burned, an opening, hitherto concealed by the huge figure of
the idol. We crowded into it; here we were at least out of
reach of the flame. But what was our chance save that of a
more lingering death? We hurried in; another portcullis
stood across the passage! What was to be our fate but famine?
We must perish in a lingering misery—of all miseries
the most appalling, and with the bitter aggravation of perishing
unknown, worthless, useless, stigmatized for slaves or
dastards! What man of Israel would ever hear of our deaths?
What chronicler of Rome would deign to vindicate our absence
from the combat?</p>

<p>We were within hearing of that combat. The assault thundered
more wildly than ever over our heads; the alternate
shout of Jew and Roman descended to us. But where were
we?—caged, dungeoned, doomed! If the earth had laid her
treasures at my feet that night, I would have given them for
one hour of freedom. Oh, for one struggle in daylight, to
redeem my name and avenge my country!</p>

<p>The roar of battle suddenly sank. Was all lost? Constantius
slain? for with life he would not yield. Was the
whole hope of Judea crushed at a blow? I cried aloud to
my followers to force the portcullis. They dragged and tore
at the bars. But it was of a solid strength that not ten times
ours could master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rescue</div>

<p>In the midst of our hopeless labors, the sound of heavy
blows above caught my ear, and fragments of rock fell in; the
blows were continued. Was this but a new expedient to crush
or suffocate us? A crevice at length showed the light of a
torch overhead. I grasped the ax to strike a last blow at the
gate and die. I heard a voice pronounce my name! Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
blow opened the roof. A face bent down, and a loud laugh
proclaimed my crazy friend.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said he, “are you there at last? You have had a
hard night’s work of it. But come up; I have an incomparable
joke to tell you about the tribune and the procurator.
Come up, my prince, and see the world.”</p>

<p>I had no time to rebuke his jocularity. I climbed up the
rugged side of the passage, and found myself still in a dungeon.
To my look of disappointment, he gave no other
answer than a laugh, and unscrewing a bar from the loophole
above his head—</p>

<p>“It is my custom,” said he, “to make myself at my ease,
wherever I go; and as prisons fall to a man’s lot, like other
things, I like to be able to leave my mansion whenever I am
tired of it.”</p>

<p>“Forward, then,” said I impatiently.</p>

<p>“Backward,” said the beggar, with the most unruffled coolness.
“That loophole is for me alone. I may be under the
governor’s care again, and I have shown it to you now merely
as a curiosity. Drink, my brave fellows,” said he, turning to
the troop below, and giving them a skin of wine; “soldiers
must have their comforts, my gallant prince, as well as beggars.
If that villain procurator had not come by express (for
no man alive is quicker to catch an idea where he is likely to
gain), you should have been by this time sleeping in the governor’s
bed, and the governor probably supping with me.
But all is fortune, good and bad, in this world. The procurator,
putting your escape and mine together, began to think
that his presence might be useful here, and the laziest rogue
in Palestine came with a speed that might have done honor to
the quickest, who stands before you in my person. I had gone
on swimmingly with the governor, on the strength of your love-letter,
angry as it made him. But the first sight of Florus put
an end to my chance of opening the gates for your triumphal
entry. I was tied, neck and heels, and flung here, to be gibbeted
to-morrow morning. But that morning has not come
yet.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Assault</div>

<p>He paced the cell uneasily. At length he sprang up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
looking from the loophole, whispered, “Now!” A low
creaking sound of machinery followed.</p>

<p>“Down into the cavern,” said he; “that accursed cohort
has moved at last. Away, my prince, and seek your fortune.”</p>

<p>I exhibited some reluctance to be engulfed again. But his
countenance assumed a sudden sternness. His only word was,
“Down!”</p>

<p>As we were parting he solemnly pronounced: “May whatever
power befriends the righteous cause, and blasts the man
of infamy and blood, send the lightnings before you!”</p>

<p>Tears stood in his uplifted eyes. His worn countenance
flushed as he spoke the words. He seized a spear from a
corner, and plunged after me into the cavern.</p>

<p>The portcullis had been drawn up by Sabat; the passage
opened at the foot of the rampart. I could have rushed upon
an army. But the hand of our guide was on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Your attack,” said he, “can be nothing, unless it be a
surprise. Move along unseen, if possible, till you come to
the flank of the first tower. There wait for my signal!”
He was gone.</p>

<p>The roar of the assault swelled again, tho it was certainly
receding. I climbed the rampart alone. The torches
on a distant battlement showed me the Romans in force, and
evidently making way. I could restrain myself no longer. I
gave the word—concealed by the shadow of the colossal wall—fell
upon the guard at the gate and cast it open! Constantius
was the first who saw me. He sprang forward, with a
cry of exultation. The Romans on the battlement feeling
themselves cut off, were struck with panic, and threw down
their arms; but we had more important objects, and rushed
back to the citadel. Our work was not yet done; we were
entangled in the streets and lost time. The garrison was
strong, and fought like men who had no resource but in the
sword.</p>

<p>We were pressed on all sides; an arrow lodged in my
shoulder, and I could wield the ax no more. In a few
discharges, every man round me was bruised or bleeding. I
saw a Roman column hurrying along the rampart, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
charge must finish the battle at once. But a blaze sprang up
in the rear of the enemy. Another and another followed.
The governor’s palace was on fire! The sight broke the
Roman courage. Cries of “treachery” rang through the
ranks; they turned, flung away spear and shield—and I was
master of the strongest fortress in Palestine!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Beggar’s
Garb</div>

<p>Resistance was at an end, and we had now only to prevent
the conflagration from snatching the prize out of our hands.
The flames rose fiercely, and another hour might see the famous
arsenal beyond the power of man. Leaving to Constantius
the care of securing the prisoners, I entered the
palace, followed by a detachment. In the tumult I had
missed my deliverer, yet scarcely could think of him, or anything
else, while the enemy were showering lances and shafts
upon us. But now, some fears of his extravagance recurred
to me, and I ordered strict search to be made for him. The
fire had seized on but a wing of the palace and was soon extinguished.
I was ascending the stairs when a figure bounded
full against me from a side door. It was the beggar. His
voice, however, was my only means of recognition, for his
outward man had undergone a total change. He wore a rich
cuirass and helmet, a Greek falchion glittered in his embroidered
belt, a tissued mantle hung over his shoulder, and a
spear ponderous, but inlaid and polished with the nicest art,
was brandished in his hand.</p>

<p>“What,” said he, “is all over? May all the fogs of earth
and skies cloud me, but I was born under the most malignant
planet that ever did mischief; I left you only to do some business
of my own; I failed there. My next business was to join
and help you to give a lesson to those Roman hounds; or, if
they were to give the lesson to us, take chance along with
you and exhibit as a soldier. I ventured to borrow the governor’s
arms, as you see, but I am always unlucky.”</p>

<p>“If it was you who set this roof on fire, your torch was
worth an army.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Beggar Confronts Florus</div>

<p>“Aye, I never saw fire fail; no man is ashamed of running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
away from a blaze; and I thought that the Romans were tired
enough, to be glad of the excuse. But I had a point besides
to carry. Florus is somewhere under these ceilings. I determined
to burn him out, and pay home my long arrear, as he
attempted to make his escape. But you have just extinguished
the cleverest earthly contrivance for the discovery of
rascal governors, and I must break an oath I made long ago,
against his ever dying in his bed.”</p>

<p>“Florus here! then we must find him without delay. But
who comes?”</p>

<p>At the word I seized a slave of the palace, attempting to
escape. He begged hard for his life, and promised to conduct
us where the procurator was concealed. We hurried on
through a succession of winding passages; a strong door
stopped us.</p>

<p>“There,” said the slave.</p>

<p>“By the beard of my fathers, the wolf shall not be long in
his den!” cried the son of El Hakim. “Procurator, your
last crime is committed.”</p>

<p>He threw himself against the door with prodigious force;
the bars burst away, and before us lay the terror of Judea.</p>

<p>He was to be a terror no more. A cup, the inseparable
amethystine cup, stood on the table beside his couch. He lay
writhing in pain. His countenance wore the ghastliest hue
of death. I bade him surrender. He smiled, took the cup in
his trembling hand, and eagerly swallowed the remaining
drops in its bottom.</p>

<p>“What! poison!” exclaimed my companion; “has the
villain escaped me? Here is my planet again; never was man
so unlucky. But he is not dead yet.”</p>

<p>He drew his falchion, and lifted it up with the look of one
about to offer a solemn sacrifice. I seized his arm.</p>

<p>“He is dying,” said I; “he is beyond earthly vengeance.”</p>

<p>The wretched criminal before us was nearly insensible to his
brief preservation. The poison, acting upon a frame already
broken with public and private anxieties, was making quick
work, and the glazed eye, the fallen countenance, and the collapsed
limb showed that his last hour was come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Death-Bed
of Gessius
Florus</div>

<p>“And this is the thing,” soliloquized the son of El Hakim,
“that men feared! In this senseless flesh was the power to
make the free tremble for their freedom, and the slave curse
the hour that he was born. This mass of mortality could
stand between me and happiness—could make me a beggar, a
wanderer, miserable, mad!”</p>

<p>He caught up the hand that hung nerveless from the
couch.</p>

<p>“Accursed hand!” exclaimed he, “what torrents of blood
have owed their flowing to thee! A word written by these
fingers cost a thousand lives. And, O Heaven! in this cruel
grasp was the key of thy dungeon, my Mary!—that dungeon
of more than the body, the hideous prison-house that extinguished
thy mind!”</p>

<p>He let fall the hand and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>To my utter surprise the procurator started upon his feet,
and with the look that had so often made the heart quake,
haughtily demanded who we were, and how we dared to interrupt
his privacy? I felt as if a spirit had started up before
me from the shroud. But this extraordinary revival was merely
the last effort of a fierce mind. He tottered, and was falling,
when my companion darted forward, grasped him by the
bosom with one hand, and waving the falchion above him with
the other—</p>

<p>“He hears! he sees!” exclaimed he exultingly. “Who
are we? Who am I? Look upon me, Gessius Florus,
before the sight leaves your eyes forever. See Sabat the
Ishmaelite, the despised, the insulted, the trampled, the
undone! But never did you prosper from the hour of my
ruin. I was your spy, but it was only to bring you into a
snare; I fed your pride, but it was only that it might turn
the hearts of all men against you; I tempted your avarice,
only that wealth might make your nights sleepless, and your
days, days of fear; I roused your wrath into rage; I inflamed
your ambition into frenzy! This night, I led your conquerors
upon you. But I had made all sure. In another week, Gessius
Florus, if you had escaped this sword, you would have
been seized by order of the Emperor, stripped of your wealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
your accursed power, and your wretched life. The command
for your blood is this night crossing the Mediterranean!”</p>

<p>The dying man struggled to get free, wrenched himself by
a violent effort from the strong grasp that at once held and
sustained him, and fell. He was dead!</p>

<p>The son of El Hakim stood gazing on the body in silence,
when the glitter of a ring on the hand, as it lay spread upon
the floor, struck his eye. He seized it with an outcry; the
man was wholly changed; his frowning visage flashed with
joy. I in vain demanded the cause. He pressed the signet
to his lips.</p>

<p>“Farewell, farewell,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Will you not wait for your share of the spoil, your ample
and deserved reward?”</p>

<p>“Farewell!” he repeated, and burst from the chamber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Change in
Constantius</div>

<p>This memorable night made changes in more than the Ishmaelite.
Constantius was at last in his element. I had
hitherto seen him disguised by circumstances; the fugitive
from his country, the lover under the embarrassments of forbidden
passion, the ill-starred soldier. His native vigor of
soul was under a perpetual cloud. But now the cloud broke
away, and the consciousness of having nobly retrieved his
check, and the still prouder consciousness of the career that
this triumph laid open before him, brought the character of
his mind into full light. He was now the lofty enthusiast
that nature made him. He breathed generous ambition; his
step was the step of command; and when he rushed to my
embrace with almost the eagerness of a boy, and a voice stifled
with emotion, I saw in him the romance, the soaring spirit,
and the passionate love of glory that molded the Greek hero.</p>

<p>He had done his duty nobly. All were in admiration of
the assault. The Romans had been fully prepared. He
scaled the rampart, and scaled it in their teeth. His men
followed gallantly. He pressed on; the second rampart was
stormed. I had found him at the foot of the third, checked
by its impregnable mass, but defying the whole garrison to
drive him back. When I afterward saw the strength of those
bulwarks, I felt that with such a leader at the head of troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
animated by his spirit, there was nothing extravagant in the
boldest hope of war.</p>

<p>This was an eventful night, and there was still much to be
done before we slept. I threw over my tattered garments one
of the many mantles that lay loose round the chamber, flung
another on the body of the procurator, and sallied forth to
give the final orders of the night. The prisoners had been
already secured, and I found the great hall of the palace
crowded with centurions. The interview was whimsical; for
a while I escaped recognition; the gashed faces and torn raiment
of my hunters, which bore the marks of our dreary
march through the subterranean; the rough heads and hands
stained with the fight, a startling contrast to the perfect
equipment of the Roman under all circumstances, gave them
the look of the robber tribes. My disguise was in the contrary
way, yet complete. The cloak was accidentally one of
the most showy in the procurator’s wardrobe. I found myself
enveloped in furs and tissues; and their Arab acquaintance
was forgotten in what seemed to them the legitimate
monarch of the mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Meets
the Captain</div>

<p>I was received by the circle of captives with the decent
dignity of the brave. There was but one exception, which I
might have guessed—the tribune. He was all humiliation,
stooped to make some abject request about his baubles, and
was probably on the point of apologizing for his ever having
taken up the trade of war, when I turned on my heel and
shook hands with my old friend the captain. He looked in
evident perplexity. At last, through even the grim evidences
of the night’s work on my countenance, and the problem of
my pompous mantle, his brightening eye began to recognize
me, and he burst out with: “The Arab, by Jupiter!” But
when I asked him what had become of his baggage, I touched
a tender string, and, with a countenance as grave as if he had
sustained an irreparable calamity, he told me that his whole
traveling cellar was in the hands of my men, and it was his
full belief that he was at that moment not worth a flask in
the wide world!</p>

<p>The tribune turned away in conscious disgrace, and I sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
him to a dungeon to meditate till morn on the awkwardness of
insolence to strangers. With the others, I sat down to such
entertainment as a sacked fortress could supply, but which
hunger, thirst, and fatigue rendered worth all the banquets
of the idle. The old captain cheered his soul and grew rhetorical.</p>

<p>“Wine,” said he, flask in hand, “does wonders. It is the
true leveler, for it leaves no troublesome inequality of conditions.
It is the true sponge that pays all debts at sight, for
it makes us forget the existence of a creditor. It is the true
friend that sticks by a man to the last drop; the faithful
mistress that forsakes no man; and the most charming of
wives, whose tongue no husband hears, whose company is
equally delightful at all hours, and who is as bewitching to-day
as she was fifty years ago.”</p>

<p>The panegyric was popular. The governor’s cellar flowed.
The Italian connoisseurship in vintages was displayed in the
most profound style, and long before we parted the great
“sponge” which wipes away debt had wiped away every recollection
of defeat. The idea of their being prisoners never
clouded a sunbeam that came from the bottle. The letters
scattered from the tribune’s saddle were an unfailing topic.
The legion had picked them up on the march; they had the
piquancy of the scandal of particular friends; and the addition
made to their intelligence by my wild associate was unanimously
declared the most dexterous piece of frolic, the
most pleasant venom, and the most venomous pleasantry, that
ever emanated from the wit of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Armory of Herod</div>

<p>My task was not yet done. I left those gay soldiers to
their wine, and with Constantius and some torch-bearers hastened
to the Armory of Herod—the forbidden ground; the
treasure-house of war; and, if old rumor were to be believed,
the place of many a mysterious celebration unlawful to be
seen by human eyes.</p>

<p>The building was in the center of the citadel,<a name="ENanchor_33" id="ENanchor_33"></a><a href="#Endnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and was of
the stateliest architecture. The massive doors were now
thrown open. At the first step, I shrank from the blaze of
steel and gold that shot back against the torches. The walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of this gigantic hall were covered with arms and armor of
every nation—cuirasses, Persian, Roman, and Greek; the
plate mail of the Gaul; the Indian chain-armor; innumerable
headpieces, from the steel cap of the Scythian to the plumed
and triple-crested helmet of the Greek, that richest combination
of strength and beauty ever borne by soldiership; shields
of every shape and sculpture; the Greek orb, the Persian
rhomb, the Cimmerian crescent; all arms—the ponderous
spear of the phalanx; the Thracian pike; the German war-hatchet;
the Italian javelin; the bow, from the Nubian, twice
the height of man, to the small half-circle of the Assyrian
cavalry; swords, the broad-bladed and fearful falchion of the
Roman, every thrust of which let out a life; the huge two-handed
sword of the Baltic tribes; the Syrian simitar; the
Persian acinaces; the deep-hilted knife of the Indian islander;
the Arab poniard; the serrated blade of the African—all were
there in their richest models, the collection of Herod’s life.
War had raised him to a rank which allowed the indulgence
of his most lavish tastes of good and ill; the sword was his
true scepter, and never king bore the sign of his sovereignty
more royally emblazoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Secret
Hall</div>

<p>After long admiration of this display of the wealth dearest
to the soldier, I was retiring, when a slave approached, and
prostrating himself, told me that a hall remained, still more
singular, “the hall in which the great Herod received his
death-warning.”</p>

<p>I gazed round the armory; there was no door but the one
by which we had entered——</p>

<p>“Not here,” said the Ethiopian, “yet it is beside us. The
foot of a Roman has never entered it. The secret remains with
me alone. Does my lord command that it shall be revealed?”</p>

<p>The order was given. The slave took down one of the coats
of mail, pushed back a valve, and we entered a winding stair
which led us downward for some minutes. The narrow passage
and heavy air reminded me of the subterranean. Our
torches burned dimly, and the visages of my attendants
showed how little their gallantry was to be relied on, if we
were to be brought into contact with magic and ghosts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here,” said the Ethiopian, “it was the custom of the great
king in his declining years, when his heart was broken by the
loss of the most beloved of wives, and maddened by the conspiracies
of the princes, his sons, to come and consult others
than the God of Jerusalem. Here the Chaldee men of wisdom
came to summon the spirits of the departed and show the
fates of kingdoms. We are now in the bowels of the mountain.”</p>

<p>He loosed a chain, which disappeared into the ground with
a hollow noise. A huge mass of rock slowly rolled back, and
showed a depth of darkness through which our twinkling
torches scarcely made way.</p>

<p>“Stop,” said the slave; “I should have first lighted the
shrine.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Skeleton
Warriors</div>

<p>He left us, and we shortly saw a blaze of many colors
on a tripod in the center. As the blaze strengthened, a
scene of wonder awoke before the eye. A host of armed
statues grew upon the darkness. The immense vault was
peopled with groups of warriors, all the great military leaders
of the world in their native arms, and surrounded by a cluster
of their captains; the disturbers of the earth, from Sesostris
down to Cæsar and Antony, brandishing the lance or reining
the charger, each in his known attitude of command. There
rushed Cyrus in the scythed chariot, surrounded by his horsemen,
barbed from head to foot. There was to be seen Alexander,
with the banner of Macedon waving above his head,
and armed as when he leaped into the Granicus; there Hannibal,
upon the elephant that he rode at Cannæ; there Cæsar,
with the head of Pompey at his feet. Those, and a long
succession of the masters of victory, each in the moment of
supreme fortune, made the vault a representative palace of
human glory. But the view from the entrance told but half
the tale. It was when I advanced and lifted the torch to the
countenance of the first group that the moral was visible.
All the visages were those of skeletons. The costly armor
was hung upon bones. The spears and scepters were brandished
by the thin fingers of the grave. The vault was the
representative sepulcher of human vanity. This was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the fantastic fits of a mind which felt too late the emptiness
of earthly honors. Half pagan, the powerful intellect of the
man gave way to the sullen superstitions of the murderer.
Egypt was still the mystic tyrant of Palestine, and Herod, in
his despair, sank into the slave of a credulity at once weak
and terrible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Herod’s Death</div>

<p>In the last hours of a long and deeply varied life, exhausted
more by misery of soul than disease, when medicine was hopeless,
and he had returned from trying the famous springs of
Callirhoë in vain, the king ordered himself to be brought into
this vault, and left alone. He remained in it during some
hours. The attendants were at length roused by hideous
wailings; they broke open the entrance, and found him in a
paroxysm of terror. The vault was filled with the strong
odors of some magical preparations, still burning on the
tripod. The sound of departing feet was heard, but Herod
sat alone. In accents of the wildest wo he declared that he
had seen the statues filled with sudden life, and charging him
with the death of his wife and children.</p>

<p>He left Masada instantly, pronouncing a curse upon the
hour in which he first listened to the arts of Egypt. He was
carried to Jericho, and there laid on a bed, from which he
never rose. Alternate bursts of blasphemy and remorse made
his parting moments frightful. But tyranny was in his last
thought, and he died, holding in his hand an order for the
massacre of every leading man in Judea.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Difficulties of a Leader</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The First
Decisive Blow</div>

<p>The first decided blow of the war was given. I had incurred
the full wrath of Rome; the trench between me and
forgiveness was impassable, and I felt a stern delight in the
conviction that hope of truce or pardon was at an end; the
seizure of Masada was a defiance of the whole power of the
empire. But it had the higher importance of a triumph at
the beginning of a war, the moment when even the courageous
are perplexed by doubt, and the timid watch their opportunity
to raise the cry of ill fortune. It showed the facility of conquest,
where men are determined to run the full risk of good
or evil; it shook the military credit of the enemy, by the
proof that they could be overmatched in activity, spirit, and
conduct. The capture of a Roman fortress by assault was a
thing almost unheard of. But the consummate value of the
enterprise was, in its declaration to those who would fight,
that they had leaders, able and willing to take the last chance
with them for the freedom of their country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Duties of Command</div>

<p>When day broke and the strength of this celebrated fortress
was fairly visible, I could scarcely believe that our success
was altogether the work of man. The genius of ancient fortification
produced nothing more remarkable than Masada. It
stood on the summit of a height so steep that the sun never
reached the bottom of the surrounding defiles. Its outer wall
was a mile round, with thirty-eight towers, each eighty feet
high. Immense marble cisterns; granaries like palaces, capable
of holding provisions for years; exhaustless arms and
military engines, in buildings of the finest Greek art; defenses
of the most costly skill at every commanding point of the
interior—all showed the kingly magnificence and warlike care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of the most brilliant, daring, and successful monarch of Judea
since Solomon.</p>

<p>By the first dawn a new wonder struck the population,
whom the tumult of the night had gathered on the neighboring
hills. I ordered the great standard of Naphtali to be
hoisted on the citadel. It was raised amid shouts and hymns,
and the huge scarlet folds spread out, majestically displaying
the emblem of our tribe, the Silver Stag, before the morn.
Shouts echoed and reechoed round the horizon. The hill-tops,
covered as far as the eye could reach, did homage to
the banner of Jewish deliverance, and inspired by the sight,
every man of their thousands took sword and spear and made
ready for war.</p>

<p>My first care was to relieve the anxieties of my family, and
Constantius, with triumph in every feature, and love and
honor glowing in his heart, was made the bearer of the glad
tidings. The duties of command now devolved rapidly on
me. An army to be raised, a plan of operations to be determined
on, the chieftains of the country to be combined, and
the profligate feuds of Jerusalem to be extinguished, were the
difficulties that lay before my first step. It is in preliminaries
like these that the burning spirit of a man, full of the manliest
resolutions and caring no more for personal safety than
he cares for the weed under his feet, is fated to feel the true
troubles of enterprise.</p>

<p>I soon experienced the disgust of having to contend with
the indolent, the artful, and the base. My mind, eager to
follow up the first success, was entangled in tedious and intricate
negotiation with men whom no sense of right or wrong
could stimulate to integrity. Rival interests to be conciliated,
gross corruption to be crushed, paltry passions to be stigmatized,
family hatreds to be reconciled, childish antipathies,
grasping avarice, giddy ambition, savage cruelty, to be
rectified, propitiated, or punished, were among my tasks
before I could plant a foot in the field. If those are the
fruits that grow round even the righteous cause, what must
be the rank crop of conspiracy?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Value of Councils</div>

<p>But one point I speedily settled. The first assemblage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the chieftains satisfied me as to the absurdity of councils of
war. Every man had his plan, and every plan had some personal
object in view. I saw that to discuss them would be
useless and endless. I had already begun to learn the diplomatic
art of taking my own way with the most unruffled aspect.
I desired the proposers to reduce their views to writing,
received their memorials with perfect civility, took them
to my cabinet, and gave their brilliancy to add to the blaze of
my fire. High station is soon compelled to dissemble. A
month before I should have spoken out my mind and treated
the plans and the proposers alike with scorn. But a month
before I was neither general nor statesman. Freed now from
the encumbrance of many councilors, I decided on a rapid
march to Jerusalem<a name="ENanchor_34" id="ENanchor_34"></a><a href="#Endnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>—there was power and glory in the word.
By this measure I should be master of all that final victory
could give, the popular mind, the national resources, and the
highest prize of the most successful war.</p>

<p>Those thoughts banished rest from my pillow. I passed
day and night in a perpetual, feverish exaltation of mind; yet
if I were to compute my few periods of happiness, among
them would be the week when I could neither eat, drink, nor
sleep, from the mere overflowing of my warlike reveries at
Masada. We may well forgive the splenetic apathy and sullen
scorn of life that beset the holder of power, when time or
chance leaves his grasp empty. The mighty monarch; the
general, on whose sword hung the balance of empires; the
statesman, on whose council rose or fell the welfare of millions,
sunk into the unexciting employments of common life,
their genius and their fame a burden and a reproach, the
source of a restless and indignant contrast between what they
were and what they are; how feeble an emblem of such minds
is the lion fanged or the eagle chained! We may pass by
even the frivolities which so often make the world stare at the
latter years of famous men. When they can no longer soar to
their natural height, all beneath is equal to them; our petty
wisdom is not worth their trouble. They scorn the little opinions
of commonplace mankind, and follow their own tastes,
contemptuously trifle and proudly play the fool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Leads
an Insurrection</div>

<p>Before the week was done, I was at the head of a hundred
thousand men; I was the champion of a great country; the
leader of the most formidable insurrection that ever contended
with Rome in the east; the general of an army whose fidelity
and spirit were not to be surpassed on earth. Could ambition
ask more? Yet there was even more, tho too solemn to be
asked by human ambition. My nation was sacred; a cause
above human nature was to be defended; in that cause I might
at once redeem my own name from obscurity, and be the instrument
of exalting the name, authority, and religion of a
people, the regal people of the Sovereign of all!</p>

<p>Constantius returned. It was in vain that I had directed
my family to take refuge in the mountain country of Naphtali.
My authority was for once disputed at home. Strong
affection mastered fear, and swift as love could speed, I saw
them enter the gates of Masada.</p>

<p>Such meetings can come but once in a life. I was surrounded
by innocent fondness, beauty most admirable, and
faith that no misfortunes could shake; and I was surrounded
by them in an hour when prosperity seemed laboring to
lavish on me all the wishes of man. I felt, too, by the
glance with which Miriam looked upon her “hero,” that I had
earned a higher title to the world’s respect. Had she found
me in chains, she would have shared them without a murmur.
But her lofty heart rejoiced to find her husband thus vindicating
his claims to the homage of mankind.</p>

<p>Yet to those matchless enjoyments I gave up but one day.
By the next dawn, the trumpet sounded for the march. I
knew the importance of following up the first blow in all
wars—its matchless importance in a war of insurrection. To
meet the disciplined troops of Rome in pitched battles would
be madness. The true maneuver was to distract their attention
by variety of onset, cut off their communications, keep
their camps in perpetual alarm, and make our activity, numbers,
and knowledge of the country the substitutes for equipment,
experience, and the science of the soldier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Omen</div>

<p>In summoning those brave men, I renewed the regulations
of the Mosaic law<a name="ENanchor_35" id="ENanchor_35"></a><a href="#Endnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>—a law whose regard for natural feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
distinguished it in the most striking manner from the stern
violences of the pagan levy. No man was required to take up
arms who had built a house and had not yet dedicated it; no
man who had planted a vineyard or olive ground, and had not
yet reaped the produce; no man who had betrothed a wife
and had not yet taken her home; and no man during the
first year of his marriage.</p>

<p>My prisoners were my last embarrassment. To leave them
to the chance of popular mercy, or to leave them immured in
the fortress, would be cruelty. To let them loose would be,
of course, to give so many soldiers to the enemy. I adopted
the simpler expedient of marching them to Berytus, seizing a
squadron of the Roman provision ships, and embarking the
whole for Italy. To my old friend the captain, whose cheerfulness
could be abated only by a failure of the vintage, I
offered a tranquil settlement among our hills. The etiquette
of soldiership was formidably tasked by my offer, for the
veteran was thoroughly weary of his thankless service. He
hesitated, swore that I deserved to be a Roman, and even
a captain of horse; but finished by saying that, bad a trade as
the army was, he was too old to learn a better. I gave him
and some others their unconditional liberty, and he parted
from the Jewish rebel with more obvious regret than perhaps
he ever dreamed himself capable of feeling for anything but
his horse and his Falernian.</p>

<p>Eleazar took the charge of my family and the command of
Masada. The sun burst out with cheerful omen on the troops,
as I wound down the steep road, named the Serpent, from its
extreme obliquity. The sight before me was of a nature to
exhilarate the heaviest heart; an immense host making
the air ring with acclamations at the coming of their chieftain.
The mental perspective of public honors and national
service was still more exalting. Yet I felt a boding depression,
as if within those walls had begun and ended my prosperity!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Marching of a Host</div>

<p>On the first ridge which crossed our march I instinctively
stopped to give a farewell look. The breeze had sunk, and
the scarlet banner shook out its folds to the sun no more; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
cloud hung on the mountain-peak and covered the fortress
with gloom. I turned away. The omen was true.</p>

<p>But sickly thoughts were forgotten when we were once
fairly on the march. Who that has ever marched with an
army has not known its ready cure for heaviness of heart?
The sound of the moving multitude, their broad mirth, the
mere trampling of their feet, the picturesque lights that fall
upon the columns as they pass over the inequalities of the
ground, keep the eye and the mind singularly alive.</p>

<p>Our men felt the whole delight of the scene, and ran about
like deer, or horses let loose into pasture. But to the military
habits of Constantius this rude vigor was the highest vexation.
He galloped from flank to flank with hopeless diligence,
found that his arrangements only perplexed our bold
peasantry the more, and at length fairly relinquished the idea
of gaining any degree of credit by the brilliancy of their discipline.
But I, no more a tactician than themselves, was
content with seeing in them the material of the true soldier.
The spear was carried awkwardly, but the hand that
carried it was strong; the march was irregular, but the
step was firm; if there were song, and mirth, and clamor,
they were the cheerful voices of the brave; and I could
read in the countenances of ranks which no skill could keep
in order, the generous devotedness that, in wars like ours,
have so often baffled the proud and left of the mighty but
clay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius Despairs</div>

<p>During the day we saw no enemy, and swept along with the
unembarrassed step of men going up to one of our festivals.
The march was hot; the zeal of our young soldiers made it
rapid, and we continued it long after the usual hour of repose.
But then sleep took its thorough revenge. It was
fortunate for our fame that the enemy was not nigh, for
sleep fastened irresistibly and at once upon the whole multitude.
Sentinels were planted in vain; the spears fell from
their hands, and the watchers were tranquilly laid side by side
with the slumbering. Outposts and the usual precautionary
arrangements were equally useless. Sleep was our master.
Constantius exerted his vigilance with fruitless activity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
before an hour passed, he and I were probably the sole sentinels
of the grand army of Judea.</p>

<p>“What can be done with such sluggards?” said he indignantly,
pointing to the heaps that, wrapped in their cloaks,
covered the fields far round, and in the moonlight looked
more like surges tipped with foam than human beings.</p>

<p>“What can be done? Wonders.”</p>

<p>“Will they ever be able to maneuver in the face of the
legions?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Will they ever be able to move like regular troops?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Will they ever be able to keep their eyes open after sunset?”</p>

<p>“Never, after such a march as we have given them to-day.”</p>

<p>“What, then, under heaven, will they be good for?”</p>

<p>“To beat the Romans out of Palestine!”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>“Never Shalt Thou Enter Jerusalem”</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Appearance
of the
Enemy</div>

<p>Before the sun was up my peasants were on the march
again. From the annual journeys of the tribes to the great
city, no country was ever known so well to its whole population,
as Palestine. Every hill, forest, and mountain stream
was now saluted with a shout of old recognition. Discipline
was forgotten as we approached those spots of memory, and
the troops rambled loosely over the ground on which in gentler
times they had rested in the midst of their caravans. Constantius
had many an irritation to encounter, but I combated
his wrath, and pledged myself that when the occasion arrived,
my countrymen would show the native vigor of the soil.</p>

<p>“Let my peasants take their way,” said I. “If they will
not make an army, let them make a mob; let them come into
the field with the bold propensities of their nature unchecked
by the trammels of regular warfare; let them feel themselves
men and not machines, and I pledge myself for their victory.”</p>

<p>“They will soon have the opportunity; look yonder.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a low range of misty hills some miles onward.</p>

<p>“Are we to fight the clouds, for I can see nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Our troops, I think, would be exactly the proper antagonists.
But there is one cloud upon those hills that something
more than the wind must drive away.”</p>

<p>The sun threw a passing gleam upon the heights, and it
was returned by the sparkling of spears. The enemy were
before us. Constantius galloped with some of our hunters to
the front, to observe their position. The trumpets sounded,
and my countrymen justified all that I had said by the enthusiasm
that lighted up every countenance at the hope of
coming in contact with the oppressor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Skilful Move</div>

<p>We advanced; shouts rang from tribe to tribe; we quickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
our pace; at length the whole multitude ran. At the
foot of the height every man pushed forward without waiting
for his fellow; it was complete confusion. The chief force
against us was cavalry, and I saw them preparing to charge.
We must suffer prodigiously, let the day end how it would.
The whole campaign might hang on the first repulse. I stood
in agony. I saw the squadrons level their lances. I saw the
centurions dash out in front. All was ready for the fatal
charge. To my astonishment, the whole of the cavalry
wheeled round and disappeared.</p>

<p>The panic was like miracle—equally rapid and unaccountable.
I rode to the top of the hill and discovered the secret.
Constantius, observing the enemy’s attention taken up with
my advance, had made his way round the heights. His
trumpet gave the first notice of the maneuver. Their rear was
threatened, and the cavalry fled, leaving a cohort in our hands.</p>

<p>Never was successful soldier honored with a more clamorous
triumph than Constantius. Nature speaks out among her untutored
sons. Envy has nothing to do in such fields as ours.
He was applauded to the skies.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, as I pressed the gallant hand that had
planted the first laurel on our brows, “you see that, if plowmen
and shepherds make rude soldiers, they make capital
judges of soldiership. You might have conquered a kingdom
without receiving half this panegyric in Rome.”</p>

<p>“The service is but begun, and we shall have another lesson
to get or give to-morrow. Those fellows are grateful, I allow,”
said he, with a smile, “but you must confess that, for
what has been done, we have to thank the discipline that
brought us into the Roman rear.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the discipline that made them so much alarmed
about their rear as to run away when they might have charged
and beaten us.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Scene of Inspiration</div>

<p>This little affair put us all in spirits, and the songs and
cheerful clamors burst out with renewed animation. But
the appearance of the enemy soon became evident. We found
the ruined cottage, the torn-up garden, the burned orchard—those
habitual evidences of the camp. As we advanced, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
tracks of wagons and of the huge wheels of the military engines
were fresh in the grass, and from time to time some
skeleton of a beast of burden, or some half-covered wreck of
man, showed that desolation had walked there; the cavalry
soon appeared on the heights in larger bodies; but all was
forgotten in the sight that at length rose upon the horizon—we
beheld, bathed in the richest glow of a summer’s eve, the
summits of the mountains round Jerusalem, and glorious above
them, like another sun, the golden beauty of the Temple of
temples!</p>

<p>What Jew ever saw that sight but with homage of heart?
Fine fancies may declaim of the rapture of returning to one’s
country after long years. Rapture! to find ourselves in a
land of strangers, ourselves forgotten, our early scenes so
changed that we can scarcely retrace them, filled up with new
faces, or with the old so worn by time and care that we read
in them nothing but the emptiness of human hope; the whole
world new, frivolous, and contemptuous of our feelings.
Where is the mother, the sister, the woman of our heart?
We find their only memorials among the dead, and bitterly
feel that our true country is the tomb.</p>

<p>But the return to Zion was not of the things of this world.
The Jew saw before him the city of prophecy and power.
Mortal thoughts, individual sorrows, the melancholy experiences
of human life, had no place among the mighty hopes
that gathered over it, like angels’ wings. Restoration, boundless
empire, imperishable glory, were the writing upon its bulwarks.
It stood before him, the Universal City, whose gates
were to be open for the reverence of all time; the symbol to
the earth of the returning presence of the Great King; the
promise to the Jew of an empire, triumphant over the casualties
of nations, the crimes of man, and even the all-grasping
avarice of the grave.</p>

<p>The multitude prostrated themselves; then rising, broke
forth into the glorious hymn sung by the tribes on their journeys
to the Temple:</p>

<p>“Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, in the city
of our God, the mountain of his holiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Tribal
Hymn</div>

<p>“Beautiful, the joy of the earth is Mount Zion, the city of
the Great King!</p>

<p>“God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</p>

<p>“We have thought of thy loving-kindness, O God, in the
midst of thy temple.</p>

<p>“Walk about Zion, tell the towers thereof. Mark ye her
bulwarks, consider her palaces. For her God is our God, forever
and ever; he will be our guide in death; his praise is to
the ends of the earth. Glory to the king of Zion.”</p>

<p>The harmony of the adoring myriads rose sweet and solemn
upon the air; the sky was a canopy of sapphire; the breeze
rich with the evening flowers; Jerusalem before me! I felt
as if the covering of my mortal nature was about to be cast
away, and my spirit to go forth on a bright and boundless
career of fortune.</p>

<p>But recollections, never to be subdued, saddened my memory
of the Temple, and when the first influence of the homage
passed, I turned from the sight of what was to me the eternal
monument of the heaviest crime of man. I gave one parting
glance as day died upon the spires. To my surprise, they
were darkened by more than twilight; I glanced again, smoke
rolled cloud on cloud over Mount Moriah; the distant roar of
battle startled us. Had the enemy anticipated our march,
and was Jerusalem about to be stormed before our eyes?</p>

<p>We were not left long to conjecture. Crowds of frightened
women and children were seen flying across the country. The
roar swelled again; we answered it by shouts and rushed onward.
Unable to ascertain the point of attack, I halted the
multitude at the entrance of one of the roads ascending to the
great gate of the upper city, and galloped forward with a few
of my people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Change in Jubal</div>

<p>A horseman rushed from the gate with a heedless rapidity
which must have flung him into the midst of our ranks or
sent him over the precipice. His voice alone enabled me to
recognize in this furious rider my kinsman Jubal. But never
had a few months so altered a human being. Instead of the
bold and martial figure of the chieftain, I saw an emaciated
and exhausted man, apparently in the last stage of life or sorrow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the florid cheek was of the color of clay; the flashing
eye was sunken; the loud and cheerful voice was sepulchral.
I welcomed him with the natural regard of our relationship,
but his perturbation was fearful; he trembled, grew fiery red,
and could return my greeting only with a feeble tongue and a
wild eye.</p>

<p>However, this was no time for private feelings. I inquired
the state of things in Jerusalem. Here his embarrassment
was thrown aside and the natural energy of the man found
room.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem has three curses at this hour,” said he fiercely,
“the priests, the people, and the Romans, and the last is the
lightest of the three;—the priests bloated with indulgence and
mad with love of the world; the people pampered with faction
and mad with bigotry; and the Romans availing themselves
of the madness of each to crush all.”</p>

<p>“But has the assault been actually made, or is there force
enough within to repel it?” interrupted I.</p>

<p>“The assault has been made, and the enemy has driven
everything before it, so far as has been its pleasure. Why
it has not pushed on is inconceivable, for our regular troops
are good for nothing. I have now been sent out to raise the
villages, but my labor will be useless, for see—the eagles are
already on the wall.”</p>

<p>I looked; on the northern quarter of the battlements I saw,
through smoke and flame, the accursed standard. Below
rose immense bursts of conflagration; the whole of the new
city, the Bezetha, was on fire. My plan was instantly formed.
I divided my force into two bodies; gave one to Constantius,
with orders to enter the city and drive the Romans from the
walls; and with the other threaded the ravines toward a position
on the hills. I had to make a long circuit. The Roman
camp was pitched on the ridge of Mount Scopas, seven furlongs
from the city. Guided by Jubal, I gained its rear. My
troops, stimulated by the sight of the fugitive people, required
all my efforts to keep them from rushing on the detachments,
which we saw successively hurrying to reenforce the assault.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another Success</div>

<p>Night fell, but the signal for my attack, a fixed number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
torches on the tower of the Temple, did not appear. Our
troops, ambushed in the olive-groves skirting the ridge, had
hitherto escaped discovery. At length they grew furious and
bore me along with them. As we burst up the rugged sides
of the hill, like a huge surge before the tempest, I cast a despairing
glance toward the city; the torches at that moment
rose. Hope lived again. The sight added wings to our speed,
and before the enemy could recover from its astonishment,
we were in the center of the camp. Nothing could be more
complete than our success. The legionaries, sure of the morning’s
march into Jerusalem and the plunder of the Temple,
were caught leaning in crowds over the ramparts, unarmed,
and making absolute holiday. Caius Cestius,<a name="ENanchor_36" id="ENanchor_36"></a><a href="#Endnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> their insolent
general, was carousing in his tent after the fatigues of the
evening. The tribunes followed his example; the soldiery
saw nothing to require their superior abstemiousness, and the
wine was flowing freely in healths to the next day’s rapine,
when our roar opened their eyes. To resist was out of the
question. Fifty thousand spearmen, as daring as ever lifted
weapon, and inflamed with the feelings of their harassed country,
were in their midst, and they fled in all directions. I
pressed on to the general’s tent, but the prize had escaped;
he had fled at the first alarm. My followers indignantly set
his quarters on fire; the blaze spread, and the flame of the
Roman camp rolled up like the flame of a sacrifice to the god
of battles.</p>

<p>The seizure of this position was the ruin of the cohorts,
abandoned between the hill and the city. At the sight of the
flames the gates were flung open, and Constantius drove the
assailants from point to point until our shouts told him that
we were marching upon their rear. The shock then was final.
The Romans, dispirited and surprised, broke like water, and
scarcely a man of them lived to boast of having insulted the
walls of Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Voice of Wo</div>

<p>Day arose and the Temple met the rising beam, unstained
by the smoke of an enemy’s fire. The wreck of the legions
lay upon the declivities, like the fragments of a fleet on the
shore. But this sight, painful even to an enemy, was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
forgotten in the concourse of the rescued citizens, the exultation
of the troops, and the still more seducing vanities that
filled the heart of their chieftain.</p>

<p>Toward noon, a long train of the principal people, headed
by the priests and elders, was seen issuing from the gates to
congratulate me. Choral music and triumphant shouts announced
their approach through the valley. My heart bounded
with the feelings of a conqueror. The whole long vista of
national honors, the popular praise, the personal dignity, the
power of trampling upon the malignant, the clearance of my
character, the right to take the future lead on all occasions of
public service and princely renown, opened before my eye.</p>

<p>I was standing alone upon the brow of the promontory. As
far as the eye could reach all was in motion, and all was directed
to me; the homage of soldiery, priests, and people centered
in my single being. I involuntarily uttered aloud:</p>

<p>“At last I shall enter Jerusalem in triumph.”</p>

<p>I heard a voice at my side:</p>

<p>“Never shalt thou enter Jerusalem but in sorrow!”</p>

<p>An indescribable pang smote me. There was not a living
soul near me to have uttered the words. The troops were
standing at a distance below and in perfect silence. The
words were spoken close to my ear. But I fatally knew the
voice, and conjecture was at an end. My limbs felt powerless,
as if I had been struck by lightning. I called Jubal up
the peak to assist me. But the blow that smote my frame
seemed to have smote his mind. His eyes rolled wildly; his
speech was the language of a fierce disturbance of thought,
altogether unintelligible. A lunatic stood before me.</p>

<p>Was this to be the foretaste of my own afflictions? Was I
to see my kindred and friends put under the yoke of bodily
and mental misery as a menace of the punishment that was
to cut asunder my connection with human nature?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel

Jerusalem</div>

<p>In pain and terror I drew my unfortunate kinsman from
the gaze of the troops, and entreated him to tell me by what
melancholy chance his feelings had been thus disturbed. He
looked at me with a fierce glance, and half unsheathed his
dagger. But I was not to be repelled, and still labored to
soothe him. He hurriedly grasped the weapon, flung it down
the steep, and sinking at my feet, burst into tears.</p>

<p>An uproar in the valley roused me from the contemplation
of this wreck of youth and hope. The enemy, tho defeated,
had suffered little comparative loss. The pride of the legions
could not brook the idea of defeat by what they deemed the
rabble of the city and the fields. Cestius, under cover of the
broken country on our flanks, had rallied the fugitives of
the camp, and now, between me and the city, were rapidly
advancing in columns, forty thousand men.</p>

<p>The maneuver was bold. It might force us either to fight
at a ruinous disadvantage, or to leave the city totally exposed.
But, like all bold games, it was perilous, and I determined to
make the Roman feel that he had an antagonist who would
not leave the game at his discretion.</p>

<p>From the pinnacle on which I stood, the whole champaign
lay beneath me. Nothing could be lovelier. The grandest
combinations of art and nature were before the eye—Jerusalem
on her hills, a city of palaces, and in that hour displaying
her full pomp; her towers streaming with banners; her
battlements crowded with troops; her priesthood and citizens
in their festal habits pouring from the gates and covering
the plain with the pageant; that plain itself colored with the
richest produce of the earth; groves of the olive; declivities,
purple with the vine or yellow with corn, gleaming in the
sun, sheets of vegetable gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Talks
to Jubal</div>

<p>The signals of my advance parties along the heights soon
told me that the enemy were in movement. My plan was
speedily adopted. On the right spread the plain; on the left
lay the broken and hilly country through which the enemy
were advancing by its three principal ravines. I felt that, if
they could unite, success with our undisciplined levies was
desperate. The only hope was that of beating the columns
separately as they emerged into the plain. Cavalry had now
begun to ride down upon the processions, which, startled at
the sight, were instantly scattered and flying toward Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“The day of congratulation is clearly over,” said Jubal,
pointing in scorn to the dispersed citizens. “To-day, at least,
you will not receive the homage of those hypocrites of the
Sanhedrin.”</p>

<p>“Nor perhaps to-morrow, fellow soldier, for we must first
see of what material those columns are made. If we beat
them, we shall save the elders the trouble of crossing the
plain, and receive their honors within the walls.”</p>

<p>“In Jerusalem!” exclaimed he wildly; “no, never! You
have dangers to encounter within those walls that no art of
man could withstand; dangers keener than the dagger, more
deadly than the aspic, more resistless than the force of armies!
Enter Jerusalem and you are undone.”</p>

<p>I looked upon him with astonishment. But there was in
his eyes a sad humility; a strangely imploring glance, which
formed the most singular contrast to the wildness of his words.</p>

<p>“Be warned!” said he, pressing close, as if he dreaded that
his secret should be overheard; “I have seen and heard horrid
things since I last entered the city. Beware of the leaders of
Jerusalem! I tell you that they have fearful power, that their
hate is inexorable, and that you are their great object!”</p>

<p>“This is altogether beyond my conception; how have I
offended, and whom?” I asked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">False Accusations</div>

<p>He seemed to have recovered the tone of his mind. “You
are charged with unutterable acts. Your abandonment of the
priesthood; sights seen in your deserted chambers, which not
even the most daring would venture to inhabit; your escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
from dangers that must have extinguished any other human
being, have bred fatal rumors. It has been said that you
worshiped in the bowels of the mountain of Masada, where
the magic fire burns eternally before the image of the Evil
One; nay, that you even conquered the fortress, impregnable
as it was to man, by a horrid compact, and that the raising of
your standard was the declared sign of that compact, dreadfully
to be repaid by you and yours!”</p>

<p>“Monstrous and incredible calumny! Where was their
evidence? My actions were before the face of the world!”</p>

<p>“If your virtues were written in a sunbeam, envy would
darken and hatred destroy,” exclaimed my kinsman, with the
bold countenance and manly feeling of his better days.
“They have in their secret councils stained you with a fate
more gloomy than I can comprehend; they say that you are sentenced,
even here, to the miseries of guilt beyond the grave.”</p>

<p>I felt as if he had stricken a lance through my heart. Fiery
sparkles shot before my eyes. I instinctively put my hand
to my brow, to feel if the mark of Cain was not already there.
I gave one hurried glance at heaven, as if to see the form of
the destroying angel stooping over me. But the consciousness
that I was in the presence of the multitude compelled me
to master my feelings. I commanded Jubal to be ready with
his proofs of those calumnies against the time when I should
confound my accusers. But I now spoke to the winds. The
interval of reason was gone. He burst out into the fiercest
horrors.</p>

<p>“They pursue me!” exclaimed he; “they come by thousands,
with the poniard and the poison! They cry for blood!
They would drive me to a crime black as their own!”</p>

<p>He flung himself at my feet, and, clasping them, prevented
every effort to save him from this degradation. He buried
his face in my robe, and, casting up a scared look from time
to time, as if he shrank from some object of terror, apostrophized
his vision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Arms Jubal</div>

<p>“Fearful being,” he cried, “spare me! turn away those
searching eyes! I have sworn to do the deed, and it shall be
done. I have sworn it, against the ties of nature, against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
laws of Heaven; but it shall be done. Now, begone! See!”—he
cowered, pointing to a cloud that floated across the sun—“see!
he spreads his wings; he hovers over me; the thunders
are flaming in his hands. Begone, Spirit of Evil! It shall be
done! Look, where he vanishes into the heights of his kingdom!
the prince of the power of the air.”</p>

<p>The cloud which fed the fancy of my unfortunate kinsman
dissolved, and with it his fear of the tempter. But he lay
exhausted at my feet, his eyes closed, his limbs shuddering—the
emblem of weakness and despair. I tried to rouse him
by that topic which would once have shot new life into his
heroic heart.</p>

<p>“Rise, Jubal, and see the enemy. This battle must not be
fought without you. To-day neither magic nor chance shall
be imputed to the conqueror, if I shall conquer. Jerusalem
sees the battle, and before the face of my country I will show
myself the leader, or will leave the last drop of my blood
upon those fields.”</p>

<p>The warrior kindled within him. He sprang from the
ground and shot down an eagle glance at the enemy, who
had now made rapid progress, and were beginning to show the
heads of their columns in the plain. He was unarmed. I gave
him my sword, and the proud humility with which he put it
to his lips was a pledge to me that it would be honored in
his hands.</p>

<p>“Glorious thing!” he exclaimed, as he flashed it before the
sun, “that raises man at once to the height of human honors,
or sends him where no care can disturb his rest; the true
scepter that graces empire; the true talisman, more powerful
than all the arts of the enchanter! What, like thee, can lift
up the lowly, enrich the destitute, and even restore the undone?
What talent, knowledge, gift of nature, nay, what
smile of fortune can, like thee, in one hour, bid the obscure
stand forth the hero of a people or the wonder of a world?
Now for glory!” he shouted to the listening circle of the
troops, who answered him with shouts.</p>

<p>“Now for glory!” they cried, and poured after him down
the side of the mountain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Onslaught</div>

<p>The three gorges of the valleys through which the enemy
moved, opened into the plain at wide intervals from one another.
I saw that the eagerness of Cestius to reach the open
ground was already hurrying his columns; and that, from
the comparative facilities of the ravine immediately under my
position, the nearest column must arrive unsupported. The
moment came. The helmets and spears were already pouring
from the pass, when a gesture from me let loose the whole
human torrent upon them. Our advantage of the ground, our
numbers, and still more, our brave impetuosity, decided the
fate of this division at once. The legionaries were not merely
repulsed, they were absolutely trampled down; there they
lay, as if a mighty wall or a fragment of the mountain had
fallen upon them.</p>

<p>The two remaining columns were still to be fought. The
compact and broad mass of iron that rushed down the ravines
seemed irresistible, and when I cast a glance on the irregular
and waving lines behind me I felt the whole peril of the day.
Yet I feared idly. The enemy charged and forced their way
into the very center of the multitude like two vast wedges,
crushing all before them. But, tho they could repel, they
could not conquer. The spirit of the Jew fighting before
Jerusalem was more than heroism. To extinguish a Roman,
tho at the instant loss of life; to disable a single spear, tho
by receiving it in his bosom; to encumber with his corpse
the steps of the adversary, was reward enough for the man of
Israel.</p>

<p>I saw crowds of those bold peasants fling themselves on
the ground, creep in between the feet of the legionaries, and
die stabbing them; others casting away the lance to seize the
Roman bucklers and encumber them with the strong grasp of
death; crowds mounting the rising grounds, to leap down
upon the spears. The enemy, overborne with the weight of
the multitude, at length found it impossible to move farther;
yet their strength was not to be broken. Wherever we
turned there was the same solid wall of shields, the same
thick fence of leveled lances. We might as well have assaulted
a rock. Our arrows rebounded from their impenetrable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
armor; the stones that poured on them from innumerable
slings rolled off like the hail of a summer shower from a
roof. But to have stopped the columns and prevented their
junction was in itself a triumph. I felt that we had scarcely
to do more than fix them where they stood, and leave the
intense heat of the day, thirst, and weariness to fight our
battle. But my troops were not to be restrained. They still
rolled in furious heaps against the living fortification. Every
broken lance in that impenetrable barrier, every pierced helmet,
was a trophy; the fall of a single legionary roused a shout
of exultation and was the signal for a new charge.</p>

<p>But the battle was no longer to be left to our unassisted
efforts; the troops in Jerusalem moved down with Constantius
at their head. In the perpetual roar of the conflict, their
shouts had escaped my ear, and my first intelligence of their
advance was from Jubal, who had well redeemed his pledge
during the day. Hurrying with him to one of the eminences
that overlooked the field, I saw with pride and delight the
standard of Naphtali spreading its red folds at the head of
the advancing multitude.</p>

<p>“Who commands them?” asked Jubal eagerly.</p>

<p>“Who should command them, with that banner at their
head,” replied I, “but my son, my brave Constantius?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius
Arrives</div>

<p>He heard no more, but, bending his turban to the saddle-bow,
struck the spur into his horse, and with a cry of madness
plunged into the center of the nearest column. The
stroke came upon it like a thunderbolt; the phalanx wavered
for the first time; an opening was made into its ranks. The
chasm was filled up by a charge of my hunters. To save or
die with Jubal was the impulse! That charge was never recovered;
the column loosened, the multitude pressed in upon
it, and Constantius arrived, only in time to see the remnant
of the Roman army flying to the disastrous shelter of the hills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel the Conqueror</div>

<p>The day was won—I was a conqueror! The invincible
legions were invincible no more. I had conquered under the
gaze of Jerusalem! Where was the enmity that would dare
to murmur against me now? What calumny would not be
crushed by the force of national gratitude? A flood of absorbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
sensations filled my soul. No eloquence of man could
express the glowing and superb consciousness that swelled
my heart, in the moment when I saw the Romans shake, and
heard the shouts of my army proclaiming me victor. After
that day, I can forgive the boldest extravagance of the boldest
passion for war. That passion may not be cruelty, nor the
thirst of possession, nor the longing for supremacy; but something
made up of them all, and yet superior to all—the essential
spirit of the stirring motives of the human mind—ambition,
kindled by the loftiest objects and ennobled by them—a
game where the stake is an endless inheritance of renown,
a sudden lifting of the man into the rank of those on whose
names time can make no impression—immortals, without
undergoing the penalty of the grave!</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Pursuit of an Enemy</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Field of
Battle</div>

<p>I determined to give the enemy no respite, and ordered
the ravines to be attacked by fresh troops. While they were
advancing, I galloped in search of Jubal over the ground of
the last charge. He was not to be seen among the living or
the dead.</p>

<p>The look of the field, when the first glow of battle had passed,
was enough to shake a sterner spirit than mine. Our advance
to the gorges of the mountain had left the plain naked. The
sea of turbans and lances was gone, rolling, like the swell of
an angry ocean, against the foot of the hills. All before us
was the cliff or the rocky pass, thronged with helmets and
spears. But all behind was death or misery worse than death;
hundreds and thousands groaning in agony, crying out for
water to cool their burning lips, or imploring the sword to put
them out of pain. The legionaries lay in their ranks as they
had fought; solid piles of men, horses, and arms, the true
monuments of soldiership. The veterans of Rome had sustained
the honors of her name.</p>

<p>I turned from this sight toward the rescued city. The sun
was resting on its towers; the smoke of the evening sacrifice
was ascending in slow wreaths from the altar of the sanctuary.
The trumpets and voices of the minstrels poured a stream of
harmony on the cool air. The recollection of gentler times
came upon my heart. Through what scenes of anxious feeling
had I not passed since those gates closed upon me. The
contrast between the holy calm of my early days and the
fierce struggles of my doomed existence pressed with bitter
force. My spirit shook. The warrior enthusiasm was chilled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel the Soldier</div>

<p>The trampling of horses roused me from this unwarlike reverie.
Constantius came up, glowing to communicate the intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
that the last of the enemy had been driven in, and
that his troops only awaited my orders to force the passes. I
mounted, heard their shouts, and was again the soldier.</p>

<p>But the iron front of the enemy resisted our boldest attempts
to force the ravines,—the hills were not to be turned, and we
were compelled, after innumerable efforts, to wait for the
movement of the Romans from a spot which thirst and hunger
must soon make untenable. This day had stripped them of
their baggage, their beasts of burden, and their military engines.</p>

<p>At dawn the pursuit began again. We still found the
enemy struggling to escape out of those fatal defiles. The
day was worn away in perpetual attempts to break the ranks
of the legionaries. The Jew, light, agile, and with nothing
to carry but his spear, was a tremendous antagonist to the
Roman, perplexed among rocks and torrents, famishing, and
encumbered with an oppressive weight of armor. The losses
of this day were dreadful. Our darts commanded their march
from the heights; every stone did execution among ranks
whose armor was now scattered by the perpetual discharge.
Still they toiled on, unbroken. We saw their long line laboring
with patient discipline through the rugged depth below,
and in the face of our attacks they made way till night again
covered them.</p>

<p>I spent that night on horseback. Fatigue I never felt in
the strong excitement of the time. I saw multitudes sink at
my horse’s feet, in sleep as insensible as the rock on which
they lay. Sleep never touched my eyelids. I galloped from
post to post, brought reenforcements to my wearied ranks, and
longed for morn.</p>

<p>It came at last. The enemy had reached the head of the
defile, but there a force was poured upon them that nothing
could resist. Their remaining cavalry were driven into the
torrent; the few light troops that scaled the higher grounds
were swept down. I looked upon their whole army as in my
hands, and was riding forward with Constantius and my chief
officers to receive their surrender, when they were saved by
one of those instances of devotedness that distinguished the
Roman character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Flight
of the
Romans</div>

<p>Wearied of pursuit and evasion, I had rejoiced to see at
last symptoms of a determination to wait for us and try the
chance of battle. An abrupt ridge of rock, surmounted
by a lofty cone, was the enemy’s position, long after famous
in Jewish annals. A line of spearmen was drawn up on the
ridge, and the broken summit of the cone, a space of a few
hundred yards, was occupied by a cohort. Italian dexterity
was employed to give the idea that Cestius had taken his stand
upon this central spot; an eagle and a concourse of officers
were exhibited, and upon this spot I directed the principal
attack to be made.</p>

<p>But the cool bravery of its defenders was not to be shaken.
After a long waste of time in efforts to scale the rock, indignant
at seeing victory retarded by such an obstacle, I left the
business to the slingers and archers, and ordered a steady
discharge to be kept up on the cohort. This was decisive.
Every stone and arrow told upon the little force crowded together
on the naked height. Shield and helmet sank one by
one under the mere weight of missiles. Their circle rapidly
diminished, and, refusing to surrender, they perished to a
man.</p>

<p>When we took possession the army was gone. The resistance
of the cohort had given the Romans time to escape, and
Cestius sheltered his degraded laurels behind the ramparts
of Bethhoron, by the sacrifice of four hundred heroes.</p>

<p>This battle, which commenced on the eighth day of the
month Marchesvan, had no equal in the war. The loss to the
Romans was unparalleled since the defeat of Crassus. Two
legions were destroyed; six thousand bodies were left on the
field. The whole preparation for the siege of Jerusalem fell
into our hands. Then was the hour to have struck the final
blow for freedom; then was given that chance of restoration
which Providence gives to every nation and every man. But
our crimes, our wild feuds, the bigoted fury and polluted license
of our factions, rose up as a cloud between us and the
light; we were made to be ruined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Fall</div>

<p>Such were not my reflections when I saw the gates of Bethhoron
closing on the fugitives; I vowed never to rest until I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
brought prisoners to Jerusalem the last of the sacrilegious host
that had dared to assault the Temple.</p>

<p>The walls of Bethhoron, manned only with the wreck of the
troops that we had routed from all their positions, could offer
no impediment to hands and hearts like ours. I ordered an
immediate assault. The resistance was desperate, for beyond
this city there was no place of refuge nearer than Antipatris.
We were twice repulsed, and I headed the third attack myself.
The dead filled up the ditch, and I had already arrived at the
foot of the rampart, with the scaling-ladder in my hand, when
I heard Jubal’s voice behind me. He was leaping and dancing
in the attitudes of utter madness. But there was no time
to be lost. I sprang upon the battlements, tore a standard
from its bearer, and waved it over my head with a shout of
victory. The plain, the hills, the valleys, covered with the
host rushing to the assault, echoed the cry; I was at the
summit of fortune!</p>

<p>In the next moment I felt a sudden shock. Darkness covered
my eyes, and I plunged headlong.</p>

<p>I awoke in a dungeon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In a
Dungeon</div>

<p>In that dungeon I lay for two years!<a name="ENanchor_37" id="ENanchor_37"></a><a href="#Endnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> How I lived, or how
I bore existence, I can now have no conception. I was not
mad, nor altogether insensible to things about me, nor even
without occasional inclination for the common objects of our
being. I used to look for the glimmer of daylight that was
suffered to enter my cell. The reflection of the moon in a
pool, of which, by climbing to the loophole, I could gain a
glimpse, was waited for with some feeble feeling of pleasure,
but my animal appetites were more fully alive than ever. An
hour’s delay of the miserable provision that was thrown
through my bars made me wretched. I devoured it like a
wild beast, and then longed through the dreary hours for its
coming again!</p>

<p>I made no attempt to escape. I dragged myself once to
the entrance of the dungeon, found it secured by an iron door,
and never tried it again. If every bar had been broken, I
scarcely know whether I should have attempted to pass it.
Even in my more reasoning hours, I felt no desire to move.
Destiny was upon me. My doom was marked in characters
which nothing but blindness could fail to read; and to struggle
with fate, what was it but to prepare for new misfortune?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prince of Naphtali is Free</div>

<p>The memory of my wife and children sometimes broke
through the icy apathy with which I labored to encrust my
mind. Tears flowed; nature stung my heart; I groaned, and
made the vault ring with the cries of the exile from earth and
heaven. But this passed away, and I was again the self-divorced
man, without a tie to bind him to transitory things.
I heard the thunder and the winds; the lightnings sometimes
startled me from my savage sleep. But what were they to
me! I was dreadfully secure from the fiercest rage of nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
There were nights when I conceived that I could distinguish
the roarings of the ocean, and, shuddering, seemed to hear
the cries of drowning men. But those, too, passed away. I
swept remembrance from my mind, and felt a sort of vague
enjoyment in the effort to defy the last power of evil. Cold,
heat, hunger, waking, sleep, were the calendar of my year,
the only points in which I was sensible of existence; I felt
like some of those torpid animals which, buried in stones from
the creation, live on until the creation shall be no more.</p>

<p>But this sullenness was only for the waking hour; night had
its old, implacable dominion over me; full of vivid misery,
crowded with the bitter-sweet of memory, I wandered free
among those forms in which my spirit had found matchless
loveliness. Then the cruel caprice of fancy would sting me;
in the very concord of enchanting sounds there would come a
funereal voice; in the circle of the happy, I was appalled by
some hideous visage uttering words of mystery. A spectral
form would hang upon my steps and tell me that I was undone.</p>

<p>From one of those miserable slumbers I was roused by a
voice pronouncing my name. I at first confounded it with
the wanderings of sleep. But a chilling touch upon my forehead
completely aroused me. It was night, yet my eyes, accustomed
to darkness, gradually discovered the first intruder
who ever stood within my living grave; nothing human could
look more like the dead. A breathing skeleton stood before
me. The skin clung to his bones; misery was in every feature;
the voice was scarcely above a whisper.</p>

<p>“Rise,” said this wretched being, “prince of Naphtali, you
are free; follow me.”</p>

<p>Strange thoughts were in the words. Was this indeed the
universal summoner—the being whom the prosperous dread,
but the wretched love? Had the King of Terrors stood before
me I could not have gazed on him with more wonder.</p>

<p>“Rise,” said the voice impatiently; “we have but an hour
till daybreak, and you must escape now or never.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freedom Foiled</div>

<p>The sound of freedom scattered my apathy. The world
opened upon my heart; country, friends, children were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the world, and I started up with the feeling of one to whom
life is given on the scaffold.</p>

<p>My guide hurried forward through the winding way to the
door. He stopped; I heard him utter a groan, strike fiercely
against the bars, and fall. I found him lying at the threshold
without speech or motion; carried him back, and, by the
help of the cruse of water left to moisten my solitary meal,
restored him to his senses.</p>

<p>“The wind,” said he, “must have closed the door, and we
are destined to die together. So be it; with neither of us can
the struggle be long. Farewell!”</p>

<p>He flung himself upon his face. A noise of some heavy
instrument roused us both. He listened, and said: “There
is hope still. The slave who let me in is forcing the door.”
We rushed to assist him, and tugged and tore at the massive
stones in which the hinges were fixed, but found our utmost
strength as ineffectual as an infant’s. The slave now cried
out that he must give up the attempt, that day was breaking
and the guard was at hand. We implored him to try
once more. By a violent effort he drove his crowbar through
one of the panels; the gleam of light gave us courage, and
with our united strength we heaved at the joints, which were
evidently loosening. In the midst of our work the slave
fled, and I heard a plunge into the pool beneath.</p>

<p>“He has perished,” said my companion. “The door is on
the face of a precipice. He has fallen, in the attempt to escape,
and we are now finally undone.”</p>

<p>The guard, disturbed by the noise, arrived, and in the
depths of our cell we heard the day spent in making the impassable
barrier firmer than ever.</p>

<p>For some hours my companion lay in that state of exhaustion
which I could not distinguish from uneasy slumber, and
which I attributed to the fatigue of our common labors. But
his groans became so deep that I ventured to rouse him, and
even to cheer him with the chances of escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Recognizes Jubal</div>

<p>“I have not slept,” said he; “I shall never sleep again,
until the grave gives me that slumber in which the wretched
can alone find rest. Escape! No—for months, for years, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
have had but one object. I have traversed mountain and sea
for it; I have given to it day and night, all that I possessed
in the world; I could give no more but my life, and that too
I was to give. I stood within sight of that object. But it is
snatched from me, and now the sooner I perish the better.”
He writhed with mental pain.</p>

<p>“But what cause can you have for being here? You have
not fought our tyrants. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“One whom you can never know—a being born to honor
and happiness, but who perverted them by pride and revenge,
and whose last miserable hope is, that he may die unknown,
and without the curses that fall on the traitor and the
murderer. Prince of Naphtali, farewell!”</p>

<p>I knew the speaker in those words of wo. I cried out:
“Jubal, my friend, my kinsman, my hero! Is it you, then,
who have risked your life to save me?”</p>

<p>I threw myself beside him. He crept from me. I caught
his meager hand; I adjured him to live and hope.</p>

<p>He started away wildly. “Touch me not; I am unfit to
live. I—I have been your ruin, and yet He who knows the
heart, knows that I alone am not to blame. I was a dupe to
furious passions, the victim of evil counselors, the prey of
disease of mind. On my crimes may Heaven have mercy!
They are beyond the forgiveness of man.”</p>

<p>By the feeble light, which showed scarcely more than the
wretchedness of my dungeon, I made some little preparations
for the refreshment of this feverish and famished being. His
story agitated him, and strongly awakened as my curiosity
was, I forbore all question. But it lay a burden on his mind,
and I suffered him to make his confession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jubal’s Explanation</div>

<p>“I loved Salome,” said he; “but I was so secure of acceptance,
according to the custom of our tribe, that I never conceived
the possibility of an obstacle to our marriage. My
love and my pride were equally hurt. The new distinctions
of her husband made my envy bitterness. To change the
scene, I went to Jerusalem. I there found malice active.
Your learning and talents had made you obnoxious long before;
your new fame and rank turned envy into hatred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Onias, whose dagger you turned from the bosom of the noble
Eleazar, remembered his disgrace. He headed the conspiracy
against you, and nothing but the heroic vigor with which you
stirred up the nation could have saved you long since from
the last extremities of faction. My unhappy state of mind
threw me into his hands. I was inflamed against you by perpetual
calumnies. It was even proposed that I should accuse
you before the Sanhedrin of dealing with the powers of darkness.
Proofs were offered which my bewildered reason
could scarcely resist. I was assailed with subtle argument;
stimulated by sights and scenes of strange import, horrid and
mysterious displays, which implicate the leaders of Jerusalem
deeply in the crime of the idolaters. Spirits, or the semblances
of spirits, were raised before my eyes; voices were
heard in the depths and in the air, denouncing you, even you,
as the enemy of Judea and of man; I was commanded, in the
midst of thunders, real or feigned, to destroy you.”</p>

<p>Here his voice sank, his frame quivered; and wrapping his
head in his cloak, he remained long silent. To relieve him
from his confession, I asked for intelligence of my family and
of the country.</p>

<p>“Of your family I can tell you nothing,” said he mournfully;
“I shrank from the very mention of their name. During
these two years I had but one pursuit—the discovery of
your prison. I refused to hear, to think, of other things. I
felt that I was dying, and I dreaded to appear before the
great tribunal with the groans from your dungeon rising up
to stifle my prayers.”</p>

<p>“But is our country still torn by the Roman wolves?”</p>

<p>“The whole land is in tumult.<a name="ENanchor_38" id="ENanchor_38"></a><a href="#Endnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Blood and horror are under
every roof from Lebanon to Idumea. The Roman sword is
out, and it falls with cruel havoc; but the Jewish dagger
pays it home, and the legions quail before the naked valor of
the peasantry. Yet what is valor or patriotism to us now?
We are in our grave!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another Chance of Escape</div>

<p>The thought of my family exposed to the miseries of a
ferocious war only kindled my eagerness to escape from this
den of oblivion. It was evening, and the melancholy moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
threw the old feeble gleam on the water which had so long
been to me the only mirror of her countenance. I suddenly
observed the light darkened by a figure stealing along the
edge of the pool. It approached, and the words were whispered:
“It is impossible to break open the door from without
while the guard is on the watch; but try whether it can not
be opened from within.” A crowbar was pushed into the
loophole; its bearer, the slave, who had escaped by swimming,
jumped down and was gone.</p>

<p>I left Jubal where he lay, lingered at the door till all external
sounds ceased, and then made my desperate attempt.
I was wasted by confinement, but the mind is force. I
labored with furious effort at the mass of bolt and bar, and
at length felt it begin to give way. I saw a star, the first for
two long years, twinkling through the fracture. Another
hour’s labor unfixed the huge hinge, and I felt the night air,
cool and fragrant, on my cheek. I now grasped the last bar,
and was in the act of forcing it from the wall when the
thought of Jubal struck me. There was a struggle of a moment
in my mind. To linger now might be to give the guard
time to intercept me. I was hungering for liberty. It was
to me at that moment what water in the desert is to the dying
caravan—the sole assuaging of a frantic thirst, of a fiery and
consuming fever of the soul. If the grains of dust under
my feet were diamonds, I would have given them to feel myself
treading the dewy grass that lay waving on the hillside
before me.</p>

<p>A tall shadow passed along. It was that of a mountain
shepherd, spear in hand, guarding his flock from the wolves.
He stopped at a short distance from the dungeon, and, gazing
on the moon, broke out with a rude but sweet voice into
song. The melody was wild, a lamentation over the fallen
glories of Judea, “whose sun was set, and whose remaining
light, sad and holy as the beauty of the moon, must soon
decay.” The word freedom mingled in the song, and every
note of that solemn strain vibrated to my heart. The shepherd
passed along.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ridicule of the Guard</div>

<p>I tore down the bar and gazed upon the glorious face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
heaven. My feet were upon the free ground! I returned
hastily to the cell and told Jubal the glad tidings, but he
heard me not. To abandon him there was to give him up to
inevitable death, either by the swords of the guard or by the
less merciful infliction of famine. I carried him on my
shoulders to the entrance. A roar of ridicule broke on me at
the threshold. The guard stood drawn up in front of the
dilapidated door; and the sight of the prisoner entrapped in
the very crisis of escape was the true food for ruffian mirth.
Staggering under my burden, I yet burst forward, but was
received in a circle of leveled spears. Resistance was now
desperate; yet even when sunk upon the ground under my
burden, I attempted to resist or gather their points in my
bosom and perish. But my feeble efforts only raised new
scoffing. I was unworthy of Roman steel, and the guard,
after amusing themselves with my impotent rage, dragged me
within the passage, placed Jubal, who neither spoke nor
moved, beside me, blocked up the door, and wished me
“better success the next time.”</p>

<p>I spent the remainder of that night in fierce agitation. The
apathy, the protecting scorn of external things, that I had nurtured,
as other men would nurture happiness, was gone. The
glimpse of the sky haunted me; a hundred times in the night
I thought that I was treading on the grass; that I felt its
refreshing moisture; that the air was breathing balm on my
cheek; that the shepherd’s song was still echoing in my ears,
and that I saw him pointing to a new way of escape from my
inextricable dungeon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Labyrinth</div>

<p>In one of those half-dreams I flung the crowbar from my
hand. A sound followed, like the fall of stones into water.
The sound continued. Still stranger echoes followed, which
my bewildered fancy turned into all similitudes of earth and
ocean—the march of troops, the distant roar of thunder, the
dashing of billows, the clamor of battle, boisterous mirth,
and the groaning and heaving of masts and rigging in storm.
The dungeon was as dark as death, and I felt my way
toward the sound. To my surprise, the accidental blow of
the bar had loosened a part of the wall and made an orifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
large enough to admit the human body. The pale light of
morning showed a cavern beyond, narrow and rugged. It
branched into a variety of passages, some of them fit for
nothing but the fox’s burrow. I returned to the lair of my
unhappy companion, and prevailed on him to follow only by
the declaration that if he refused I must perish by his side.
My scanty provisions were gathered up. I led the way, and,
determined never to return to the place of my misery, we set
forward to tempt in utter darkness the last chances of famine—pilgrims
of the tomb.</p>

<p>We wandered through a fearful labyrinth for a period which
utterly exhausted us. Of night and day we had no knowledge.
I was sinking, when a low groan struck my ear. I listened
pantingly; it came again. It was evidently from some object
close beside me. I put forth my hand and pushed in the
door of a large cavern; a flash of light illumined the passage.
Another step would have plunged us into a pool a thousand
feet below.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Death in a Cavern</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">An Ocean
Temple</div>

<p>The cavern thus opened to us<a name="ENanchor_39" id="ENanchor_39"></a><a href="#Endnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> seemed to be the magazine
of some place of trade. It was crowded with chests and
bales, heaped together in disorder. What dangerous owners
we might meet cost us no question; life and liberty were before
us. I cheered Jubal till his scattered senses returned,
and he clasped my feet in humiliation and gratitude.</p>

<p>We were now like men created anew. We forced our way
through piles that but an hour before would have been mountains
to our despairing strength. The cavern opened into another,
which seemed the dwelling of some master of extraordinary
opulence. Silken tissues hung on the walls; the ceiling
was a Tyrian canopy; precious vases stood on tables of citron
and ivory. A large lyre, superbly ornamented, was suspended
in an opening of the rock, and gave its melancholy music to
the wind. But no human being was to be seen. Was this
one of the true wonders that men classed among the fictions
of Greece and Asia? The Nereids with their queen could not
have sought a more secluded palace. Onward we heard the
sounds of ocean. We followed them, and saw one of those
scenes of grandeur which nature creates, as if to show the littleness
of man.</p>

<p>An arch three times the height of the loftiest temple, and
ribbed with marble, rose broadly over our heads. Innumerable
shafts of the purest alabaster, rounded with the perfection
of sculpture, rose in groups and clusters to the solemn
roof; wildflowers and climbing plants of every scent and hue
gathered round the capitals, and hung the gigantic sides of
the hall with a lovelier decoration than ever was wrought in
loom. The awful beauty of this ocean temple bowed the
heart in instinctive homage. I felt the sacredness of nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
But this grandeur was alone worthy of the spectacle to which
it opened. The whole magnificence of the Mediterranean
spread before our eyes, smooth as polished silver and now
reflecting the glories of the west. The sun lay on the horizon
in the midst of crimson clouds, like a monarch on the funeral
pile, sinking in the splendors of a conflagration that lighted
earth and ocean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the
Edge of the
Cavern</div>

<p>But at this noble portal we had reached our limit. The
sides of the cavern projected so far into the waters as to make
a small anchorage. Access or escape by land was palpably
impossible. Yet, here at least, we were masters. No claimant
presented himself to dispute our title. The provisions of
our unknown host were ample, and, to our eager tastes, were
dangerous from their luxury. The evening that we passed at
the mouth of the cave, exhilarated with the first sensation of
liberty, and enjoying every aspect and voice of the lovely
scene with the keenness of the most unhoped-for novelty,
was a full recompense for the toils and terrors of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>The sun went down. The surge that died at our feet murmured
peace; the wheeling sea-birds, as their long trains
steered homeward, pouring out from time to time a clangor
of wild sounds that descended to us in harmony; the little
white-sailed vessels, that skimmed along the distant waters
like summer flies; the breeze waving the ivy and arbutus,
that festooned our banquet-hall, alike spoke to the heart the
language of peace.</p>

<p>“If,” said I, “my death-bed were to be left to my own
choice, on the edge of this cavern would I wish to take my
last farewell.”</p>

<p>“To the dying all places must be indifferent,” replied my
companion; “when Death is at hand, his shadow fills the
mind. What matters it to the exile, who in a few moments
must leave his country forever, on what spot of its shore his
last step is planted? Perhaps the lovelier that spot the
more painful the parting. If I must have my choice, let me
die in the dungeon or in battle: in the chain that makes me
hate the earth, or in the struggle that makes it forgotten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yet,” said I, “even for battle, if we would acquit ourselves
as becomes men, is not some previous rest almost essential?
and for the sterner conflict with that mighty enemy
before whom our strength is vapor, is it not well to prepare
the whole means of mental fortitude? I would not perish in
the irritation of the dungeon, in the blind fury of man
against man, nor in the hot and giddy whirl of human cares.
Let me lay my sinking frame where nothing shall intrude
upon the nobler business of the mind. But these are melancholy
thoughts. Come, Jubal, fill to the speedy deliverance
of our country.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jubal’s
Remorse</div>

<p>“Here, then, to her speedy deliverance, and the glory of
those who fight her battles!” The cup was filled to the brim,
but just as the wine touched his lips he flung it away. “No,”
exclaimed he, in bitterness of soul, “it is not for such as I to
join in the aspirations of the patriot and the soldier. Prince
of Naphtali, your generous nature has forgiven me, but
there is an accuser here”—and he struck his withered
hand wildly upon his bosom—“that can never be silenced.
Under the delusions, the infernal delusions of your enemies,
I followed you through a long period of your career, unseen.
Every act, almost every thought, was made known to me, for
you were surrounded by the agents of your enemies. I was
driven on by the belief that you were utterly accursed by our
law, and that to drive the dagger to your heart was to redeem
our cause. But the act was against my nature, and in the
struggle my reason failed. When I stood before you on the
morning of the great battle, you saw me in one of those fits of
frenzy that always followed a new command to murder. The
misery of seeing Salome’s husband once more triumphant
finally plunged me into the Roman ranks to seek for death.
I escaped, followed the army, and reached Bethhoron in the
midst of the assault. Still frantic, I thought that in you I
saw my rival victorious. It was this hand, this parricidal
hand, that struck the blow.” He covered his face and wept
convulsively.</p>

<p>The mystery of my captivity was now cleared up, and feeling
only pity for the ruin that remorse had made, I succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
at last in restoring him to some degree of calmness. I even
ventured to cheer him with the hope of better days, when in
the palace of his fathers I should acknowledge my deliverer.</p>

<p>With a pressure of the hand and a melancholy smile, “I
know,” said he, “that I have not long to live. But if a
prayer of mine is to be answered by that greatest of all Powers
whom I have so deeply offended, it would be, to die in
some act of service for my prince and my pardoner! But
hark!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Dying
Man</div>

<p>A groan was uttered close to the spot where we sat. I
perceived for the first time an opening behind some furniture;
entered, and saw lying on a bed a man apparently in
the last stage of exhaustion.</p>

<p>He exclaimed: “Three days of misery—three days left
alone, to die—without food, without help, abandoned by all.
But I have deserved it. Traitor and villain as I am, I have
deserved a thousand deaths!”</p>

<p>I looked upon this outcry as but the raving of pain, and
brought him some wine. He swallowed it with avidity, but
even while I held the cup to his lips, he sank back with a cry
of horror.</p>

<p>“Aye,” cried he, “I knew that I could not escape you; you
have come at last. Spirit, leave me to die! Or if,” said he,
half rising and looking in my face with a steady yet dim
glare, “you can tell the secrets of the grave, tell me what is
my fate. I adjure you, fearful being, by the God of Israel;
by the gods of the pagan, or if you acknowledge any god beyond
the dreams of miserable man, tell me what I am to be?”</p>

<p>I continued silent, struck with the agony of his features.
Jubal entered, and the looks of the dying man were turned
on him.</p>

<p>“More of them!” he exclaimed, “more tormentors! more
terrible witnesses of the tortures of a wretch whom earth
casts out! What I demand of you is the fate of those who
live as I have lived—the betrayer, the plunderer, the man
of blood? But you will give me no answer. The time of
your power is not come.”</p>

<p>He lay for a short period in mental sufferings; then, starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
upon his feet by an extraordinary effort of nature, and
with furious execrations at the tardiness of death, he tore off
the bandage which covered a wound on his forehead. The
blood streamed down and made him a ghastly spectacle.</p>

<p>“Aye,” cried he, as he looked upon his stained hands, “this
is the true color; the traitor’s blood should cover the traitor’s
hands. Years of crime, this is your reward. The betrayal of
my noble master to death, the ruin of his house, the destruction
of his name; these were the right beginnings to the life
of the robber.”</p>

<p>A peal of thunder rolled over our heads and the gush of
the rising waves roared through the cavern.</p>

<p>“Aye, there is your army,” he cried, “coming in the storm.
I have seen your angry visages at night in the burning village;
I have seen you in the shipwreck; I have seen you in
the howling wilderness; but now I see you in shapes more
terrible than all.”</p>

<p>The wind bursting through the long vaults forced open the
door.</p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome to your prey!” he yelled, and drawing
a knife from his sash, darted it into his bosom. The act was
so instantaneous that to arrest the blow was impossible. He
fell and died with a brief, fierce struggle.</p>

<p>“Horrible end,” murmured Jubal, gazing on the silent
form; “happier for that wretch to have perished in the hottest
strife of man or nature, trampled in the charge or
plunged into the billows! Save me from the misery of lonely
death!”</p>

<p>“Yet,” said I, “it was our presence that made him feel.
He was guilty of some crime, perhaps of many, that the sight
of us awoke to torment his dying hour. I saw that he gazed
upon me with evident alarm, and not improbably my withered
face, and those rags of my dungeon, startled him into recollections
too strong for his decaying reason.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen him before?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>I gave a reluctant look at the hideous distortion of a countenance
still full of the final agony. I turned away in awe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Jubal, to think of ourselves. Soon we shall have
fairly tried our experiment. A few days must exhaust our
provisions. The surges roll on the one hand; on the other
we have the rock.”</p>

<p>“But we shall die at least in pomp,” said Jubal. “No
king of Asia will lie in a nobler vault, nor even have sincerer
rejoicings at his end; the crows and vultures are no hypocrites.”</p>

<p>The dead man’s turban had fallen off in his last violence,
and I perceived the corner of a letter in its folds. I read it;
its intelligence startled me. It was from the commandant of
the Roman fleet on the coast mentioning that a squadron was
in readiness to “attack the pirates in their cavern.”</p>

<p>A heavy sound, as if something of immense weight had
rushed into the entrance of the arch, followed by many voices,
stopped our conversation.</p>

<p>“The Romans have come,” said I, “and now you will be
indulged with your wish—our lives are forfeited—for never
will I go back to the dungeon.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arrival
of Pirates</div>

<p>“I hear no sound but that of laughter,” said Jubal, listening;
“those invaders are the merriest of cutthroats. But before
we give ourselves actually into their hands, let us see of
what they are made.”</p>

<p>We left the chamber and returned to the recess from which
we had originally emerged. It commanded a view of the
chief avenues of the cavern; and while I secured the door,
Jubal mounted the wall, and reconnoitered the enemy through
a fissure.</p>

<p>“These are no Romans,” whispered he, “but a set of the
most jovial fellows that ever robbed on the seas. They have
clearly been driven in by the storm, and are now preparing to
feast. Their voyage has been lucky, if I am to judge by the
bales that they are hauling in; and if wine can do it, they will
be in an hour or two drunk to the last man.”</p>

<p>“Then we can take advantage of their sleep, let loose one
of their boats, and away,” said I.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plunderers</div>

<p>I mounted to see this pirate festivity. In the various vistas
of the huge cavern groups of bold-faced and athletic men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
were gathering, all busy with the work of the time; some piling
fires against the walls and preparing provisions; some
stripping off their wet garments and bringing others out of
heaps of every kind and color, in the recesses of the rock;
some wiping the spray from rusty helmets and corselets.
The vaults rang with songs, boisterous laughter, the rattling
of armor, and the creaking and rolling of chests of plunder.
The dashing of the sea under the gale filled up this animated
dissonance; and at intervals the thunder, bursting directly
above our heads, mingled with all and overpowered all.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>A Pirate Band</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A Pirate Feast</div>

<p>The chamber whose costly equipment first told us of the
opulence of its masters was set apart for the chief rovers,
who were soon seated at a large table in its center, covered
with luxury. Flagons of wine were brought from cellars
known only to the initiated; fruits piled in silver baskets
blushed along the board; plate of the richest workmanship,
the plunder of palaces, glittered in every form; tripods loaded
with aromatic wood threw a blaze up to the roof; and from
the central arch hung a superb Greek lamp, shooting out light
from a hundred mouths of serpents twined in all possible
ways. The party before me were about thirty<a name="ENanchor_40" id="ENanchor_40"></a><a href="#Endnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> as fierce-looking
figures as ever toiled through tempest; some splendidly
attired, some in the rough costume of the deck; but all jovial,
and evidently determined to make the most of their time.
Other men had paid for the banquet, and there was probably
not a vase on their table that was not the purchase of personal
hazard. They sat, conquerors, in the midst of their own
trophies; and not the most self-indulgent son of opulence
could have luxuriated more in his wealth, nor the most exquisite
student of epicurism have discussed his luxuries with
more finished and fastidious science. Lounging on couches
covered with embroidered draperies, too costly for all but
princes, they lectured the cooks without mercy: the venison,
pheasants, sturgeon, and a multitude of other dishes were in
succession pronounced utterly unfit to be touched, and the
wine was tasted, and often dismissed, with the caprice of
palates refined to the highest point of delicacy. Yet the sea
air was not to be trifled with, and a succession of courses
appeared, and were despatched with a diligence that prohibited
all language beyond the pithy phrases of delight or disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wine-Tasters</div>

<p>The wine at length set the conversation flowing, and from
the merits of the various vintages the speakers diverged into
the general subjects of politics and their profession; on the
former of which they visited all parties with tolerably equal
ridicule; and on the latter, declared unanimously that the
only cause worthy of a man of sense was the cause for which
they were assembled round that table. The next stage was
the more hazardous one of personal jocularity; yet even this
was got over with but a few murmurs from the parties suffering.
Songs and toasts to themselves, their loves, and their
enterprises in all time to come relieved the drier topics; and
all was good fellowship until one unlucky goblet of spoiled
wine soured the banquet.</p>

<p>“So, this you call Chian,” exclaimed a broad-built figure,
whose yellow hair and blue eyes showed him to be a son of the
North; “may I be poisoned,” and he made a hideous grimace,
“if more detestable vinegar ever was brewed; let me but meet
the merchant, and I shall teach him a lesson that he will remember
when next he thinks of murdering men at their meals.
Here, baboon, take it; it is fit only for such as you.”</p>

<p>He flung the goblet point-blank at the head of a negro,
who escaped it only by bounding to one side with the agility
of the ape that he much resembled.</p>

<p>“Bad news, Vladomir, for our winter’s stock, for half of
it is Chian,” said a dark-featured and brilliant-eyed Arab,
who sat at the head of the table. “Ho! Syphax, fill round
from that flagon, and let us hold a council of war upon the
delinquent wine.”</p>

<p>The slave dexterously changed the wine; it was poured
round, pronounced first-rate, and the German was laughed at
remorselessly.</p>

<p>“I suppose I am not to believe my own senses,” remonstrated
Vladomir.</p>

<p>“Oh! by all means, as long as you keep them,” said one,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me that I don’t know the difference between
wine and that poison?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Dispute</div>

<p>“Neither you nor any man, friend Vladomir, can know much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
upon the subject after his second dozen of goblets,” sneered
another at the German’s national propensity.</p>

<p>“You do him injustice,” said a subtle-visaged Chiote at the
opposite side of the table. “He is as much in his senses this
moment as ever he was. There are brains of that happy constitution
which defy alike reason and wine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall say no more,” murmured the German sullenly,
“than confound the spot on which that wine grew,
wherever it lies; the hungriest vineyard on the Rhine would
be ashamed to show its equal. By Woden, the very taste
will go with me to my grave.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may,” said the Chiote, irritated for the honor
of his country, and significantly touching his dagger. “But
were you ever in the island?”</p>

<p>“No; nor ever shall, with my own consent, if that flagon
be from it,” growled the German, with his broad eye glaring
on his adversary. “I have seen enough of its produce, alive
and dead to-night.”</p>

<p>The wind roared without, and a tremendous thunder-peal
checked the angry dialog. There was a general pause.</p>

<p>“Come, comrades, no quarreling,” cried the Arab.
“Heavens, how the storm comes on! Nothing can ride out
to-night. Here’s the captain’s health, and safe home to
him.”</p>

<p>The cups were filled; but the disputants were not to be so
easily reconciled.</p>

<p>“Ho! Memnon,” cried the master of the table to a sallow
Egyptian richly clothed, whose simitar and dagger sparkled
with jewels. He was engaged in close council with the rover
at his side. “Lay by business now; you don’t like the wine
or the toast?”</p>

<p>The Egyptian, startled from his conference, professed his
perfect admiration of both, and sipping, returned to his whisper.</p>

<p>“Memnon will not drink for fear of letting out his secrets;
for instance, where he found that simitar, or what has become
of the owner,” said a young and handsome Idumean with a
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Egyptian
Questioned</div>

<p>“I should like to know by what authority you ask me questions
on the subject. If it had been in your hands, I should
have never thought any necessary,” retorted the scowling
Egyptian.</p>

<p>“Aye, of course not, Memnon; my way is well known.
Fight rather than steal; plunder rather than cheat; and,
after the affair is over, account to captain and crew, rather
than glitter in their property,” was the Idumean’s answer, with
a glow of indignation reddening his striking features.</p>

<p>“By the by,” said the Arab, in whose eye the gems flashed
temptingly, “I think Memnon is always under a lucky star.
We come home in rags, but he regularly returns the better for
his trip; Ptolemy himself has not a more exquisite tailor. All
depends, however, upon a man’s knowledge of navigation in
this world.”</p>

<p>“And friend Memnon knows every point of it but plain
sailing,” said the contemptuous Idumean.</p>

<p>The Egyptian’s sallow skin grew livid. “I may be coward,
or liar, or pilferer,” exclaimed he; “but if I were the whole
three, I could stand no chance of being distinguished in the
present company.”</p>

<p>“Insult to the whole profession,” laughingly exclaimed the
Arab. “And now I insist, in the general name, on your giving
a plain account of the proceeds of your last cruise. You
can be at no loss for it.”</p>

<p>“No; for he has it by his side, and in the most brilliant
arithmetic,” said Hanno, a satirical-visaged son of Carthage.</p>

<p>“I must hear no more on the subject,” bitterly pronounced
the Egyptian. “Those diamonds belong to neither captain
nor crew. I purchased them fairly, and the seller was, I
will undertake to say, the better off of the two.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I will undertake to say,” laughed the Idumean,
“that you left him the happiest dog in existence. It is care
that makes man miserable, and the less we have to care for
the happier we are. I have not a doubt you left the fellow
at the summit of earthly rapture!”</p>

<p>“Aye!” added the Arab, “without a sorrow or a shekel in
the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Quarrel
Over Wine</div>

<p>Boisterous mirth followed the Egyptian, as he started from
his couch and left the hall, casting fierce looks in his retreat,
like Parthian arrows, on the carousal. The German had, in
the mean time, fallen back in a doze, from which he was disturbed
by the slave’s refilling his goblet.</p>

<p>“Aye, that tastes like wine,” said he, glancing at the Greek,
who had by no means forgotten the controversy.</p>

<p>“Taste what it may, it is the very same wine that you railed
at half an hour ago,” returned the Chiote; “the truth is, my
good Vladomir, that the wine of Greece is like its language;
both are exquisite and unrivaled to those who understand
them. But Nature wisely adapts tastes to men, and men to
tastes. I am not at all surprised that north of the Danube
they prefer beer.”</p>

<p>The German had nothing to give back for the taunt but
the frown that gathered on his black brow.</p>

<p>The Chiote pursued his triumph, and with a languid, lover-like
gaze on the wine, which sparkled in purple radiance to
the brim of its enameled cup, he apostrophized the produce
of his fine country.</p>

<p>“Delicious grape!—essence of the sunshine and of the dew!—what
vales but the vales of Chios could have produced thee?
What tint of heaven is brighter than thy hue? What fragrance
of earth richer than thy perfume?”</p>

<p>He lightly sipped a few drops from the edge, like a libation
to the deity of taste.</p>

<p>“Exquisite draft!” breathed he; “unequaled but by the
rosy lip and melting sigh of beauty! Well spoke the proverb:
‘Chios, whose wines steal every head, and whose women,
every heart.’”</p>

<p>“You forget the rest,” gladly interrupted the German—“and
whose men steal everything.”</p>

<p>A general laugh followed the retort, such as it was.</p>

<p>“Scythian!” said the Greek across the table, in a voice
made low by rage, and preparing to strike.</p>

<p>“Liar!” roared the German, sweeping a blow of his
falchion, which the Chiote escaped only by flinging himself on
the ground. The blow fell on the table, where it caused wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
devastation. All now started up; swords were out on every
side, and nothing but forcing the antagonists to their cells
prevented the last perils of a difference of palate. The storm
bellowed deeper and deeper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Captain</div>

<p>“Here’s to the luck that sent us back before this north-wester
thought of stirring abroad,” said the Arab. “I wish
our noble captain were among us now. Where was he last
seen?”</p>

<p>“Steering westward, off and on Rhodes, looking out for the
galley that carried the procurator’s plate. But this wind
must send him in before morning,” was the answer of Hanno.</p>

<p>“Or send him to the bottom, where many as bold a fellow
has gone before him,” whispered a tall, haggard-looking
Italian to the answerer.</p>

<p>“That would be good news for one of us at least,” said
Hanno. “You would have no reckoning to settle. Your
crew made a handsome affair of the Alexandrian prize, and
the captain might be looking for returns, friend Tertullus.”</p>

<p>“Then let him look to himself. His time may be nearer
than he thinks. His haughtiness to men as good as himself
may provoke justice before long,” growled the Italian, in
memory of some late discipline.</p>

<p>Hanno laughed loudly.</p>

<p>“Justice!—is the man mad? The very sound is high treason
in our gallant company. Why, comrade, if justice ever
ventured here, where would some of us have been these last
six months?”</p>

<p>The sound caught the general ear; the allusion was understood,
and the Italian was displeased.</p>

<p>“I hate to be remarkable,” said he; “with the honest it
may be proper to be honest; but beside you, my facetious
Hanno, a man should cultivate a little of the opposite school
in mere compliment to his friend. You had no scruples when
you hanged the merchant the other day.”</p>

<p>A murmur arose in the hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Philosophy of Robbers</div>

<p>“Comrades,” said Hanno, with the air of an orator, “hear
me too on that subject: three words will settle the question
to men of sense. The merchant was a regular trader. Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
any man who knows the world, and has brains an atom clearer
than those with which fate has gifted my virtuous friend,
believe that I, a regular liver by the merchant, would extinguish
that by which I live? Sensible physicians never kill a
patient while he can pay; sensible kings never exterminate a
province when it can produce anything in the shape of a tax;
sensible women never pray for the extinction of our sex until
they despair of getting husbands; sensible husbands never
wish their wives out of the world while they can get anything
by their living: so, sensible men of our profession will never
put a merchant under water until they can make nothing by
his remaining above it. I have, for instance, raised contributions
on that same trader every summer these five years; and,
by the blessing of fortune, hope to have the same thing to say
for five times as many years to come. No, I would not see
any man touch a hair of his head. In six months he will
have a cargo again, and I shall meet him with as much pleasure
as ever.”</p>

<p>The Carthaginian was highly applauded.</p>

<p>“Malek, you don’t drink,” cried the Arab to a gigantic
Ethiopian toward the end of the table. “Here, I pledge you
in the very wine that was marked for the Emperor’s cellar.”</p>

<p>Malek tasted it, and sent back a cup in return.</p>

<p>“The Emperor’s wine may be good enough for him,” was
the message; “but I prefer the wine yonder, marked for the
Emperor’s butler.”</p>

<p>The verdict was fully in favor of the Ethiopian.</p>

<p>“In all matters of this kind,” said Malek, with an air of
supreme taste, “I look first to the stores of the regular professors—the
science of life is in the masters of the kitchen
and the cellar. Your emperors and procurators, of course,
must be content with what they can get. But the man who
wishes to have the first-rate wine should be on good terms with
the butler. I caught this sample on my last voyage after
the imperial fleet. Nero never had such wine on his table.”</p>

<p>He indulged himself in a long draft of this exclusive
luxury, and sank on his couch, with his hand clasping the
superbly embossed flagon—a part of his prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Ethiopian’s
Taint</div>

<p>“The black churl,” said a little shriveled Syrian, “never
shares; he keeps his wine as he keeps his money.”</p>

<p>“Aye, he keeps everything but his character,” whispered
Hanno.</p>

<p>“There you wrong him,” observed the Syrian; “no man
keeps his character more steadily. By Beelzebub! it is like
his skin; neither will be blacker the longest day he has to
live.”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter rose round the hall.</p>

<p>“Black or not black,” exclaimed the Ethiopian, with a sullen
grin, that showed his teeth like the fangs of a wild beast,
“my blood’s as red as yours.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” retorted the little Syrian; “but as I must take
your word on the subject till I shall have seen a drop of it
spilt in fair fight, I only hope I may live and be happy till
then; and I can not put up a better prayer for a merry old
age.”</p>

<p>“There is no chance of your ever seeing it,” growled the
Ethiopian; “you love the baggage and the hold too well to
leave them to accident, be the fight fair or foul.”</p>

<p>The laugh was easily raised, and it was turned against the
Syrian, who started up and declaimed with a fury of gesture
that made the ridicule still louder.</p>

<p>“I appeal to all,” cried the fiery orator; “I appeal to every
man of honor among us, whether by night or day, on land or
water, I have ever been backward.”</p>

<p>“Never at an escape,” interrupted the Ethiopian.</p>

<p>“Whether I have ever broken faith with the band?”</p>

<p>“Likely enough; where nobody trusts, we may defy treason.”</p>

<p>“Whether my character and services are not known and
valued by our captain?” still louder exclaimed the irritated
Syrian.</p>

<p>“Aye, just as little as they deserve.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Appearance of Salathiel</div>

<p>“Silence, brute!” screamed the diminutive adversary, casting
his keen eyes, that doubly blazed with rage, on the Ethiopian,
who still lay embracing the flagon at his ease. “With
heroes of your complexion I disdain all contest. If I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
fight, it shall be with human beings; not with savages—not
with monsters.”</p>

<p>The Ethiopian’s black cheek absolutely grew red; this taunt
was the sting. At one prodigious bound he sprang across the
table, and darted upon the Syrian’s throat with the roar and
the fury of a tiger. All was instant confusion; lamps,
flagons, fruits, were trampled on; the table was overthrown;
swords and poniards flashed in all hands. The little Syrian
yelled, strangling in the grasp of the black giant, and it was
with the utmost difficulty that he could be rescued. The
Arab, a fine athletic fellow, achieved this object, and bade
him run for his life—a command with which he complied unhesitatingly,
followed by a cheer from Hanno, who swore that
if all trades failed, he would make his fortune by his heels at
the Olympic games.</p>

<p>Our share in the scene was come. The fugitive, naturally
bold enough, but startled by the savage ferocity of his antagonist,
made his way toward our place of refuge. The black
got loose and pursued. I disdained to be dragged forth as a
lurking culprit, and flinging open the door stood before the
crowd. The effect was marvelous. The tumult was hushed
at once. Our haggered forms, seen by that half-intoxication
which bewilders the brain before it enfeebles the senses, were
completely fitted to startle the superstition that lurks in the
bosom of every son of the sea; and for the moment they
evidently took us for something better, or worse, than man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spies</div>

<p>But the delusion was short-lived; my voice broke the spell,
and perhaps the consciousness of their idle alarm increased
their rage. “Spies!” was then the outcry, and this dreaded
sound brought from beds and tables the whole band. It was
in vain that I attempted to speak; the mob have no ears,
whether in cities or caves, and we were dragged forward to
undergo our examination. Yet what was to be done in the
midst of a host of tongues, all questioning, accusing, and
swearing together?</p>

<p>Some were ready to take every star of heaven to witness
that we were a pair of Paphlagonian pilots, and the identical
ones hired to run two of their ships aground, by which the
best expedition of the year was undone. Others knew us to
have been in the regular pay of the procurator, and the means
of betraying their last captain to the ax. But the majority
honored us with the character of simple thieves, who had
taken advantage of their absence to plunder the baggage.</p>

<p>The question next arose, “How we could have got in?”
and for the first time the carousers thought of their sentinel.
I told them what I had seen. They poured into his chamber,
and their suspicions were fixed in inexorable reality: “We
had murdered him.” The speediest death for us was now the
only consideration. Every man had his proposal, and never
were more curious varieties of escape from this evil world
offered to two wretches already weary of it; but the Arab’s
voice carried the point. “He disliked seeing men tossed into
the fire; ropes were too useful, and the sword was too honorable
to be employed on rogues. But as by water we came, by
water we should go.” The sentence was received with a
shout; and amid laughter, furious cries, and threats of vengeance,
we were dragged to the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arrival of
the Captain</div>

<p>There was a new scene. The tempest was appalling. The
waves burst into the anchorage in huge heaps, dashing sheets
of foam up to its roof. The wind volleyed in gusts, that took
the strongest off their feet; the galleys at anchor were tossed
as if they were so many weeds on the surface of the water.
Lamps and torches were useless, and the only light was from
the funereal gleam of the billows, and the sheets of sulfurous
fire that fell upon the turbulence of ocean beyond. Even the
hardy forms round me were startled, and I took advantage of
a furious gust that swung us all aside, to struggle from their
grasp, and seizing a pike, fight for my life. Jubal seconded
me with the boldness that no decay could exhaust, and setting
our backs to the rocks, we for a while baffled our executioners.
But this could not last against such numbers. Our pikes
were broken; we were hemmed in, and finally dragged again
to the mouth of the cavern, that with its foam and the howl
of the tumbling billows looked like the jaws of some huge
monster ready for its prey.</p>

<p>Bruised and overpowered, I was on the point of denying my
murderers their last indulgence, and plunging headlong, when
a trumpet sounded. The pirates loosed their hold, and in a
few minutes a large galley with all her oars broken and every
sail torn to fragments shot by the mouth of the cavern. A
joyous cry of, “The captain! the captain!” echoed through
the vaults. The galley, disabled by the storm, tacked several
times before she could make the entrance; but at length, by
a masterly maneuver, she was brought round, and darted
right in on the top of a mountainous billow. Before she
touched the ground, the captain had leaped into the arms of
the band, who received him with shouts. His quick eye fell
upon us at once, and he demanded fiercely what we were.
“Spies and thieves” was the general reply.</p>

<p>“Spies!” he repeated, looking contemptuously at our
habiliments—“impossible. Thieves, very likely, and very
beggarly ones.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Captain’s Story</div>

<p>I denied both imputations alike. He seemed struck by my
words, and said to the crowd: “Folly! Take them away, if
it does not require too much courage to touch them; and let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
them be washed and fed for the honor of hospitality and their
own faces. Here, change my clothes and order supper.”</p>

<p>I attempted to explain how we came.</p>

<p>“Of course—of course,” said the captain, pulling off his
dripping garments and flinging his cloak to one, his cuirass
to another, and his cap to a third. “Your rags would vouch
for you in any port on earth. Or, if you carry on the trade
of treachery, you are very ill paid. Why, Memnon, look at
these fellows; would you give a shekel for their souls and
bodies? Not a mite. When I look for spies, I expect to find
them among the prosperous. However, if you turn out to be
spies, eat, drink, and sleep your best to-night, for you shall
be hanged to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He hurried onward, and we followed, still in durance.
The banquet was reinstated, and the principal personages of
the band gathered round to hear the adventures of the voyage.</p>

<p>“All has been ill luck,” said the captain, tossing off a
bumper. “The old procurator’s spirit was, I think, abroad
either to take care of his plate or to torment mankind, according
to his custom. We were within a boat’s length of the
prize when the wind came right in our teeth. Everything
that could, ran for the harbor; some went on the rocks; some
straight to the bottom; and that we might not follow their
example, I put the good ship before the wind, and never was
better pleased than to find myself at home. Thus you see,
comrades, that my history is brief; but then it has an advantage
that history sometimes denies itself—every syllable of it
is true.”</p>

<p>As the light of the lamps fell on him, it struck me that his
face was familiar to my recollection. He was young, but the
habits of his life had given him a premature manhood; his
eye flashed and sparkled with Eastern brilliancy, but his
cheek, after the first flush of the banquet, was pale; and the
thinness of a physiognomy naturally masculine and noble,
showed that either care or hardship had lain heavily upon his
days. He had scarcely sat down to the table when, his
glance turning where we stood guarded, he ordered us to be
brought before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel and
the Captain</div>

<p>“I think,” said he, “you came here but a day or two ago.
Did you find no difficulty with our sentinels?”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the Arab, “how could I have forgotten
that? I left Titus, or by whatever of his hundred names he
chose to be called, on guard, at his own request, the day I
steered for the Nile. He was sick, or pretended to be so;
and as I gave myself but a couple of days for the voyage, I
expected to be back in time to save him from the horrors of
his own company. But the wind said otherwise—the two
days were ten; and on my return we found the wretched fellow
a corpse—whether from being taken ill and unable to
help himself, or from the assistance of those worthy persons
here whom we discovered in attendance.”</p>

<p>“On that subject I have no doubt whatever,” interposed
the Egyptian; “those villains murdered him.”</p>

<p>“It is possible,” mused the captain; “but I can not foresee
what they are to get by it. A question that you at least
will acknowledge to be of considerable importance,” said he,
with a careless smile at the Egyptian, whose avarice was
proverbial.</p>

<p>The object of satire was stung, and to get rid of the dangerous
topic, he affected wrath and said impetuously:</p>

<p>“Let it be so; let our blood go for nothing; let treachery
thrive; let our throats be at the mercy of every wandering
ruffian; and let us have the consolation that our labors and
our sacrifices will be honored with a sneer.”</p>

<p>He turned to the crowd waiting round us. “Brave comrades,”
exclaimed he, “henceforth understand that you are at
every dagger’s mercy; that if you are left behind, you may
be assassinated with impunity, as, if you are taken out upon
our foolish expeditions, your lives may be flung away upon
the whims and follies of would-be heroes.”</p>

<p>The crowd, fickle and inflamed by wine, gave a huzza for
the “sailor’s friend.” The Egyptian encouraged, and having
a load of gall upon his memory, made the desperate venture
of at once disowning the authority of the captain, and ordering
in his own name that we should be delivered over to execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Shows a Letter</div>

<p>The captain listened without a word, but his hand was on
his simitar, and his cheek burned, as he fixed his eyes on the
livid accuser.</p>

<p>The crowd pressed closer upon us, and I saw the dagger
pointed at my breast, when I recollected the letter. I gave
it to the captain, who read it in silence, and then, with the
utmost composure, desired it to be handed over to the Egyptian.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” said he, “I have to apologize for a breach of
the confidence that should always subsist between men of
honor. I have here accidentally read a letter which the
cipher shows to have been intended for our trusty friend
Memnon; but since the subject is no longer confined to himself,
he will doubtless feel no objection to indulging us all
with the correspondence.”</p>

<p>The band thronged round the table; expectation sat on
every face, and its various expression in the crowded circle of
those strong physiognomies—the keen, the wondering, the
angry, the contemptuous, the convinced, the triumphant—would
have made an incomparable study for a painter. The
Egyptian took the letter with a trembling hand and read the
fatal words.</p>

<p>“The fleet will be off the northern promontory by midnight.
You will light a signal, and be ready to conduct the
troops into the cavern.”</p>

<p>The reader let the fatal despatch fall from his hands.</p>

<p>An outcry of wrath rose on all sides, and the traitor was on
the point of being sacrificed when the young Idumean generously
started forward.</p>

<p>“It is known, I believe, to every man here,” said he, “that I
dislike and distrust Memnon as much as any being on earth.
I know him to be base and cruel, and therefore hate him. I
have long suspected him of being connected with transactions
that nothing but the madness of avarice could venture upon,
and nothing but death atone. But he must not perish without
a trial. Till inquiry is made, the man who strikes him
must strike through me.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Egyptian’s Treachery</div>

<p>He placed himself before the culprit, who now taking courage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
long and dexterously insisted that the letter was a forgery,
invented by “assassins and those who employed assassins.”</p>

<p>The tide of popular wisdom is easily turned; opinion was
now raging against me, and the Egyptian stood a fair chance
of seeing his reputation cleared in my blood.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the captain, rising, “as we are not likely to
gain much information from the living, let us see whether the
dead can give us any: lead on, prisoners.”</p>

<p>I led the way to the recess. The dead man lay untouched;
but in the interval the features had returned, as is often the
case in death, to the expression of former years. I uttered
an exclamation; he was the domestic who had betrayed me to
the procurator.</p>

<p>“Conscience!” cried the Egyptian.</p>

<p>“Conscience!” echoed the crowd.</p>

<p>The captain turned to me. “Did either you or your companion
commit this murder? I will have no long stories. I
know that this fellow was a villain, and if he had lived until
my return, he should have fed the crows within the next
twelve hours. One word—yes or no?”</p>

<p>I answered firmly.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” said the captain. He took the hand of
the corpse, and called to the Egyptian. “Take this hand,
and swear that you know nothing of the treason. But, ha!
what have we here?”</p>

<p>As he lifted the arm, the sleeve of the tunic gave way,
and a slip of papyrus fell on the bed. He caught it up, and
exclaiming, “What! to-night? pernicious villain!” turned to
the astonished band.</p>

<p>“Comrades, there is treachery among us. We are sold—sold
by that accursed Egyptian. Strip the slave, and fling
him into the dungeon until I return; no, he shall come with
us in chains. Call up the men. Every galley must put to
sea instantly, if we would not be burned in our beds.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparing for the Escape</div>

<p>The trumpets sounded through the cavern, and rapid preparations
were made for obeying this unexpected command.
The fires blazed again; arms and armor rang; men were mustered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and the galleys swung out from their moorings, in the
midst of tumult and volleys of execrations against the treachery
that “could not wait, at least, for daylight and fair
weather.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said the captain, “I think that it is time for me
to sup. Sit down, and let us hear over our wine what story
the prisoners have to tell.”</p>

<p>I briefly stated our escape from the dungeon.</p>

<p>“It may be a lie; yet the thing hangs not badly together.
Your wardrobe speaks prodigiously in favor of your veracity.
Ho, Ben Ali! see that the avenue into the warehouse is
stopped up. We must have no visits from the garrison of the
tower.”</p>

<p>He had soon a group of listeners round the table.</p>

<p>“As I was lying off and on, waiting to catch that galley,
a correspondent on shore let me partly into the secret of that
Egyptian dog’s dealings. Rich as the knave was—and how
he came by his money, Tartarus only knows—Roman gold
had charms for him still. In fact, he had been carrying on
a very handsome trade in information during the last six
months, which may best account for the escape of two fleets
from Byzantium, and not less for the present safety of the
procurator’s plate, which, however, I hope, by the blessing of
Neptune, to see before another week shining upon this table.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to me, he laughingly said: “Tho I should
not trust you for pilotage, your discovery was of use. That
an attack upon us was intended I was aware; but the how
and the when were the difficulty. The time of the attack was
announced in the papyrus, and but for the storm we should
probably be now doing other things than supping.”</p>

<p>“The sea is going down already, and the wind has
changed,” said the Arab. “We can haul off the shore without
loss of time.”</p>

<p>“Then the sooner the better. We must seal up the Romans
in their port, or if they venture out on such a night,
give them sound reason for wishing that they had stayed at
home. Their galleys, if good for nothing else, will do to
burn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Company
of the
Free-Traders</div>

<p>This bold determination was received with a general cheer;
the crews drank to the glory of their expedition, and all rushed
toward the galleys, which, crowded with men, lay tossing at
the edge of the arch.</p>

<p>I followed, and demanded what was to be our fate.</p>

<p>“What will you have?”</p>

<p>“Anything but abandonment here. Let us take the chances
of your voyage, and be set on shore at the first place you
touch.”</p>

<p>“And sell our secret to the best bidder? No. But I have
no time to make terms with you now. One word for all;
ragged as you both are, you are strong, and your faces would
do no great discredit to our profession. You probably think
this no very striking compliment,” said he, laughing. “However,
I have taken a whim to have you with us and offer you
promotion. Will you take service with the noble company of
the Free-trade?”</p>

<p>Jubal was rashly indignant; I checked him, and merely
answered that I had purposes of extreme exigency which prevented
my accepting his offer.</p>

<p>“Ha, morality!” exclaimed he, “you will not be seen with
rogues like us?” He laughed aloud. “Why, man, if you
will not live, eat, drink, travel, and die with rogues, where
upon earth can you expect to live or die? The difference between
us and the world is that we do the thing without the
additional vice of hypocrisy.”</p>

<p>The bold fellows who waited round us felt for the honor of
their calling, and but for their awe of the captain we had stood
slight chance of escape.</p>

<p>“A pike might let a little light into their understandings,”
said one.</p>

<p>“If they will not follow on the deck, they should swim at
the stern,” said another.</p>

<p>“The hermits should be sent back to their dungeon,” said
a third.</p>

<p>The boat was now run up on the sand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Captain’s Calling</div>

<p>“Get in,” said the captain. “I have taken it into my
head to convince you by fact of the honor, dignity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
primitiveness of our profession, which is, in the first place,
the oldest, for it was the original employment of all human
hands; in the next place, the most universal, for it is the
principle of all trades, pursuits, and professions, from the
Emperor on his throne down through the doctor, the lawyer,
and the merchant, to the very sediment of society.”</p>

<p>A loud laugh echoed through the cavern.</p>

<p>While he was arranging his corselet and weapons round him,
the captain proceeded: “The Free-trade is the essence of the
virtues. For example, I meet a merchantman loaded with
goods—for what is the cargo meant? To purchase slaves; to
tear fathers from their families—husbands from their wives;
to burn villages, and bribe savages to murder each other. I
strip the hold; the slave-market is at an end, and none suffer
but fellows who ought to have been hanged long ago.”</p>

<p>The captain’s doctrine was more popular than ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On Board the Galleys</div>

<p>“I see, comrades,” said the captain, “that tho truth is persuasive,
your huzza is not for me, but for fact. We find a
young rake ranging the world with more money than brains,
sowing sedition among the fair rivals for the honor of sharing
his purse; running away with daughters; gambling greater
fools than himself out of their fortunes; in short, playing the
profligate in all shapes. He drops into our hands, and we
strip him to the last penny. What is the consequence? We
make him virtuous on the spot. The profligate becomes a
model of penitence; the root of all his ills has been unearthed;
the prodigal is saving; the bacchanal temperate; the seducer
lives in the innocence of a babe; the gambler never touches a
die. We have broken the mainspring of his vices—money;
disarmed the soft deceiver of his spell—money; checked the
infection of the gambler’s example by cutting off the source
of the disease—money; or if nothing can teach him common
sense, our dungeon will at least keep him out of harm’s way.
We meet a rich old rogue,” continued he, “on his voyage between
the islands. What is he going to do? To marry some
young creature who has a young lover, perhaps a dozen.
The marriage would break her heart and raise a little rebellion
in the island. We capture the old Cupid, strip him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
his coin, and he is a Cupid no more; fathers and mothers
abhor him at once; the young lover has his bride and the
old one his lesson; the one gets his love and the other his
experience; and both have to thank the gallant crew of the
<i>Scorpion</i>, which may Neptune long keep above water.”</p>

<p>A joyous shout and the waving of caps and swords hailed
the captain’s display. “The Free-trade forever!” was
cheered in all directions.</p>

<p>“And now, my heroes of salt water, noble brothers of the
Nereids, sons of the starlight, here I make libation to fortune.”</p>

<p>He poured a part of his cup into the wave, and drank to
the general health with the remainder.</p>

<p>“Happiness to all! Let our work to-night be what it will,
I know, my heroes, that it will be handsomely done. The
enemy may call us names, but you will answer them by
proofs that, whatever we may be, we are neither slaves nor
dastards. If I catch the insolent commander of the Roman
fleet, I will teach him a lesson in morals that he never knew
before. He shall flog, fleece, and torture no more. I will
turn the hard-hearted tyrant into tenderness from top to toe.
His treatment of the crew of the <i>Hyæna</i> was infamous; and,
by Jupiter! what I owe him shall be discharged in full.
Now on board, and may Neptune take care of you!”</p>

<p>The trumpets flourished, the people cheered, the boats
pushed off, the galleys hoisted every sail, and in a moment we
found ourselves rushing through the water under the wildest
canopy of heaven.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>A Sea Fight</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Captain as
Seaman</div>

<p>We stretched out far to sea, for the double purpose of falling
by surprise upon the Roman squadron and of avoiding the
shoals. The wind lulled at intervals so much that we had
recourse to our oars; it would then burst down with a violence
that all but hurled us out of the water. I now saw
more of the captain, and was witness to the extraordinary
activity and skill of this singular young man. Never was
there a more expert seaman. For every change of sea or
wind he had a new expedient; and when the hearts of the
stoutest sank, he took the helm into his hands and carried us
through the chaos of foam, whirlwind, and lightning with
the vigor of one born to sport with the storm.</p>

<p>As I was gazing over the vessel’s side at the phosphoric
gleams that danced along the billows, he came up to me.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said he, “that we have been compelled to
give you so rough a specimen of our hospitality, and this is
not altogether a summer sea, but you saw how the matter
stood. The enemy would have been upon us, and the whole
advantage of our staying at home would be to have our throats
cut in company.”</p>

<p>Odd and rambling as his style was, there was something in
his manner and voice that had struck me before, even in the
boisterousness of the convivial crowd. But now, in the solitary
sea, there was a melancholy sweetness in his tones that
made me start with sad recollection. Yet, when by the lightning
I attempted to discover in his features any clue to memory,
and saw but the tall figure wrapped in the sailor’s cloak,
the hair streaming over his face in the spray, and every line
of his powerful physiognomy at its full stretch in the agitation
of the time, the thought vanished again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">His Request</div>

<p>“I hinted,” said he, after an interval of silence, “at your
taking chance with us. If you will, you may. But the hint
was thrown out merely to draw off the fellows about me, and
you are at full liberty to forget it.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible to join you,” was my answer; “my life is
due to my country.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for that matter, so is mine, and due a long time ago;
my only wonder is, how I have evaded payment till now.
But I am a man of few words. I have taken a sort of liking
to you, and would wish to have a few such at hand. The
world calls me pirate, and the majority, of course, carries the
question. For its opinion I do not care a cup of water; a
bubble would weigh as heavily with me as the rambling, giddy,
vulgar judgment of a world in which the first of talents is
knavery. I never knew a man fail who brought to market
prostitution of mind enough to make him a tool, vice enough
to despise everything but gain, and cunning enough to keep
himself out of the hands of the magistrate till opulence enabled
him to corrupt the law or authority to defy it. But let
that pass. The point between us is, will you take service
with us?”</p>

<p>“No! I feel the strongest gratitude for the manliness and
the generosity of your protection. You saved our lives, and
our only hope of revisiting Judea in freedom is through you.
But, young man, I have a great cause in hand. I have risked
everything for it. Family, wealth, rank, life, are my stake;
and I look upon every hour given to other things as so far a
fraud upon my country.”</p>

<p>I heard him sigh. There was silence on both sides for a
while, and he paced the deck; then suddenly returning, laid
his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“I am convinced of your honor,” said he, “and far be it
from me to betray a man who has indeed a purpose worthy
of manhood into our broken and unhappy—aye, let the word
come out, infamous career. But you tell me that I have been
of some use to you; I now demand the return. You have refused
to take service with me. Let me take service with
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Presence
of the
Roman Fleet</div>

<p>I stared at him. He smiled sadly, and said: “You will
not associate with one stained like me. Aye, for me there is
no repentance! Yet, why shall the world”—and his voice
was full of anguish—“why shall an ungenerous and misjudging
world be suffered to keep forever at a distance those
whom it has first betrayed?” His emotion got the better of
him, and his voice sank. He again approached me. “I am
weary of this kind of life. Not that I have reason to complain
of the men about me, nor that I dislike the chances of
the sea; but that I feel the desire to be something better—to
redeem myself out of the number of the dishonored; to do
something which, whether I live or die, will satisfy me that
I was not meant to be—the outcast that I am.”</p>

<p>“Then join us, if you will,” said I. “Our cause demands
the bold; and the noblest spirit that ever dwelt in man would
find its finest field in the deliverance of our land, the land of
holiness and glory. But can you leave all that you have
round you here?”</p>

<p>“Not without a struggle. I have an infinite delight in this
wild kind of existence. I love the strong excitement of hazard;
I love the perpetual bustle of our career; I love even
the capriciousness of wind and wave. I have wealth in return
for its perils; and no man knows what enjoyment is but
he who knows it through the fatigue of a sailor’s life. All
the banquets of Epicureanism are not half so delicious as even
the simplest meal to his hunger, nor the softest bed of luxury
half so refreshing as the bare deck to his weariness. But
I must break up those habits; and whether beggar, slave, or
soldier obtaining the distinction of a soldier’s success, I am
determined on trying my chance among mankind.”</p>

<p>A sheet of lightning at this instant covered the whole horizon
with blue flame, and a huge ball of fire springing from the
cloud, after a long flight over the waters split upon the shore.
The keenness of the seaman’s eye saw what had escaped mine.</p>

<p>“That was a lucky sea-light for us,” said he. “The Romans
are lying under yonder promontory, driven to take
shelter by the gale, of course; but for that fire-ball they
would have escaped me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Gives
the Order</div>

<p>All the crew were now summoned on deck; signals were
made to the other galleys; the little fleet brought into close
order; pikes, torches, and combustibles of all kinds gathered
upon the poop; the sails furled, and with muffled oars we glided
down upon the enemy. The Roman squadron, with that
precaution which was the essential of its matchless discipline,
was drawn up in order of battle, tho it could have had no
expectation of being attacked on such a night. But the roar
of the gale buried every other sound, and we stole round the
promontory unheard.</p>

<p>The short period of this silent navigation was one of the
keenest anxiety. All but those necessary for the working of
the vessel were lying on their faces; not a limb was moved,
and like a galley of the dead we floated on, filled with destruction.
We were yet at some distance from the twinkling
lights that showed the prefect’s trireme when, on glancing
round, I perceived a dark object on the water, and pointed it
out to the captain.</p>

<p>“Some lurking spy,” said he, “who was born to pay for his
knowledge.”</p>

<p>With a sailor’s promptitude he caught up a lamp and
swung it overboard. It fell beside the object, a small boat,
as black as the waves themselves.</p>

<p>“Now for the sentinel,” were his words, as he plunged into
the sea. The act was as rapid as the words. I heard a
struggle, a groan, and the boat floated empty beside me on
the next billow.</p>

<p>But there was no time to wait for his return. We were
within an oar’s length of the anchorage. To communicate
the probable loss of their captain (and what could human
struggle do among the mountainous waves of that sea?)
might be to dispirit the crew and ruin the enterprise. I took
the command upon myself, and gave the word to fall on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Suddenness of Mutiny</div>

<p>A storm of fire, as strange to the enemy as if it had risen
from the bottom of the sea, was instantly poured on the advanced
ships. The surprise was complete. The crews, exhausted

shrouds and sails falling down in burning fragments on their
heads. Our shouts gave them the idea of being attacked by
overwhelming numbers, and after a short dispute we cleared
the whole outer line of every sailor and soldier. The whole
was soon a pile of flame, a sea volcano that lighted sky,
sea, and shore.</p>

<p>Yet only half our work was done. The enemy were now
fully awake, and no man could despise Roman preparation.
I ordered a fire galley to run in between the leading ships;
but she was caught half-way by a chain, and turned round,
scattering flame among ourselves. The boats were then
lowered, and our most desperate fellows sent to cut out or
board. But the crowded decks drove them back, and the
Roman pike was an over-match for our short falchions. For
a while we were forced to content ourselves with the distant
exchange of lances and arrows. The affair now became critical.
The enemy were still three times our force; they were
unmooring, and our only chance of destroying them was at
anchor. I called the crew forward and proposed that we
should run the galley close on the prefect’s ship, set them
both on fire, and in the confusion carry the remaining vessels.
But sailors, if as bold, are as capricious as their element.
Our partial repulse had already disheartened them.
I was met by clamors for the captain. The clamors rose into
open charges that I had, to get the command, thrown him
overboard.</p>

<p>I was alone. Jubal, worn out with fatigue and illness,
was lying at my feet, more requiring defense than able to
afford it. The crowd was growing furious against the
stranger. I felt that all depended on the moment, and
leaped from the poop into the midst of the mutineers.</p>

<p>“Fools,” I exclaimed, “what could I get by making away
with your captain? I have no wish for your command. I
have no want of your help. I disdain you: bold as lions
over the table; tame as sheep on the deck; I leave you to be
butchered by the Romans. Let the brave follow me, if such
there be among you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Monarch of a War Galley</div>

<p>A shallop that had just returned with the defeated boarders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
lay by the galley’s side. I seized a torch. Eight or ten,
roused by my taunts, followed me into the boat. We pulled
right for the Roman center. Every man had a torch in one
hand and an oar in the other. We shot along the waters, a
flying mass of flame; and while both fleets were gazing on us
in astonishment, rushed under the stern of the commander’s
trireme. The fire soon rolled up her tarry sides and ran
along the cordage. But the defense was desperate, and lances
rained upon us. Half of us were disabled in the first discharge;
the shallop was battered with huge stones, and I felt
that she was sinking.</p>

<p>“One trial more, brave comrades, one glorious trial more!
The boat must go down, and unless we would go along with it,
we must board.”</p>

<p>I leaped forward and clung to the chains. My example
was followed. The boat went down; and this sight, which
was just discovered by the livid flame of the vessel, raised a
roar of triumph among the enemy. But to climb up the tall
sides of the trireme was beyond our skill, and we remained,
dashed by the heavy waves as she rose and fell. Our only
alternatives now were to be piked, drowned, or burned. The
flames were already rapidly advancing; showers of sparkles
fell upon our heads; the clamps and ironwork were growing
hot to the touch; the smoke was rolling over us in suffocating
volumes. I was giving up all for lost when a mountainous
billow swept the vessel’s head round, and I saw a blaze burst
out from the shore,—the Roman tents were on fire!</p>

<p>Consternation seized the crews, thus attacked on all sides;
and uncertain of the number of the assailants, they began to
desert the ships and by boats or swimming make for the
various points of the land. The sight reanimated me. I
climbed up the side of the trireme, torch in hand, and with
my haggard countenance, made still wilder by the wild work
of the night, looked a formidable apparition to men already
harassed out of all courage. They plunged overboard—and
I was monarch of the finest war-galley on the coast of Syria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Conflagration</div>

<p>But my kingdom was without subjects. None of my own
crew had followed me. I saw the pirate vessels bearing down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
to complete the destruction of the fleet, and hailed them, but
they all swept far wide of the trireme. The fire had taken
too fast hold of her to make approach safe. I now began to
feel my situation. The first sense of triumph was past, and
I found myself deserted. The deed of devastation, meanwhile,
was rapidly going on. I saw the Roman ships successively
boarded, almost without resistance, and in a blaze.
The conflagration rose in sheets and spires to the heavens, and
colored the waters to an immeasurable extent with the deepest
dye of gore. I heard the victorious shouts, and mine rose
spontaneously along with them. In every vessel burned, in
every torch flung, I rejoiced in a new blow to the tyrants of
Judea. But my thoughts were soon fearfully brought home.
The fire reached the cables; the trireme, plunging and tossing
like a living creature in its last agony, burst away from her
anchors; the wind was off the shore; a gust, strong as the
blow of a battering-ram, struck her; and on the back of a
huge wave she shot out to sea, a flying pyramid of fire.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>A Burning Trireme</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Solitary
Voyager</div>

<p>Never was man more indifferent to the result than the
solitary voyager of the burning trireme. What had life for
me? I gazed round me. The element of fire reigned supreme.
The shore—mountain, vale, and sand—was bright
as day from the blaze of the tents and the floating fragments
of the galleys. The heavens were an arch of angry splendor—every
stooping cloud swept along reddened with the various
dyes of the conflagration below. The sea was a rolling
abyss of the fiercest color of slaughter. The blazing vessels,
loosened from the shore, rushed madly before the storm, sheet
and shroud shaking loose abroad like vast wings of flame.</p>

<p>At length all disappeared. The shore faded far into a dim
line of light; the galleys sank or were consumed; the sea
grew dark again. But the trireme, strongly built and of
immense size, still fed the flame, and still shot on through
the tempest, that fell on her the more furiously as she lost
the cover of the land. The waves rose to a height that often
baffled the wind, and left me floating in a strange calm between
two black walls of water reaching to the clouds, and
on whose smooth sides the image of the burning vessel was
reflected as strongly as in a mirror. But the ascent to the
summit of those fearful barriers again let in the storm in its
rage. The tops of the billows were whirled off in sheets of
foam; the wind tore mast and sail away, and the vessel was
dashed forward like a stone discharged from an engine. I
stood on the poop, which the spray and the wind kept clear
of flame, and contemplated, with some feeling of the fierce
grandeur of the spectacle, the fire rolling over the forward
part of the vessel in a thousand shapes and folds.</p>

<p>While I was thus careering along, like the genius of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
upon his throne, I caught a glimpse of sails scattering in
every direction before me—I had rushed into the middle of
one of those small trading-fleets that coasted annually between
the Euxine and the Nile. They flew, as if pursued by
a fiend. But the same wind that bore them, bore me; and
their screams, as the trireme bounded from billow to billow
on their track, were audible even through the roarings of the
storm. They gradually succeeded in spreading themselves so
far that the contact with the flame must be partial. But on
one, the largest and most crowded, the trireme bore inevitably
down. The hunted ship tried every mode of escape in
vain; it maneuvered with extraordinary skill; but the pursuer,
lightened of every burden, rushed on like a messenger
of vengeance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sound of
a Voice</div>

<p>I could distinctly see the confusion and misery of the crowd
that covered the deck; men and women kneeling, weeping,
fainting, or, in the fierce riot of despair, struggling for some
wretched spoil that a few moments more must tear from all
alike. But among the fearful mingling of sounds, one voice
I suddenly heard that struck to my soul. It alone roused me
from my stern scorn of human suffering. I no longer looked
upon those beings as upon insects, that must be crushed in the
revolution of the great wheel of fate. The heart, the living
human heart, palpitated within me. I rushed to the side of
the trireme, and with voice and hand made signals to the
crew to take me on board. But at my call a cry of agony
rang through the vessel. All fled to its farther part, but a
few, who, unable to move, were seen on their knees, and in
the attitudes of preternatural fear, imploring every power of
heaven. Shocked by the consciousness that, even in the hour
when mutual hazard softens the heart of man, I was an object
of horror, I shrank back. I heard the voice once more, and
once more resolving to get on board, flung a burning fragment
over the side to help me through the waves.</p>

</div>

<p>But the time was past. The fragment had scarcely touched
the foam when a sheet of lightning wrapped sea and sky; the
flying vessel was gone. My eye looked but upon the wilderness
of waters. The flash was fatal. It had struck the hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of my trireme, in which was stowed a large freightage of the
bitumen and niter of the desert. A column of flame, white as
silver, rose straight and steadily up to the clouds; and the
huge ship, disparting timber by timber, reeled, heaved, and
plunged headlong into the bosom of the ocean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In a
Whirlpool</div>

<p>I rose to the surface from a prodigious depth. I was nearly
breathless. My limbs were wasted with famine and fatigue;
but the tossing of the surges sustained and swept me
on. The chill at last benumbed me, and my limbs were
heavy as iron, when a broken mast rolling by entangled me
in its cordage. It drove toward a point of land, round which
the current swept. Strongly netted in the wreck, I was
dragged along, sometimes above the billow, sometimes below.
But a violent shock released me, and with a new terror I felt
myself go down. I was engulfed in the whirlpool!</p>

<p>Every sensation was horribly vivid. I had the full consciousness
of life and of the unfathomable depth into which
I was descending. I heard the roar and rushing of the
waters round me; the holding of my breath was torture; I
strained, struggled, tossed out my arms, and grasped madly
around, as if to catch something that might retard my hideous
descent. My eyes were open. I never was less stunned by
shock or fear. The solid darkness, the suffocation, the furious
whirl of the eddy that spun me round its huge circle like
an atom of sand—every sense of drowning—passed through
my shattered frame with an individual and successive pang.
I at last touched something, whether living or dead, fish or
stone, I know not; but the impulse changed my direction,
and I was darted up to the surface in a little bay sheltered
by hills.</p>

<p>The storm had gone with the rapidity of the south. The
sun burned bright and broad above my head; the pleasant
breath of groves and flowery perfumes came on the waters; a
distant sound of sweet voices lingered on the air. Like one
roused from a frightful dream, I could scarcely believe that
this was reality. But the rolling waters behind gave me sudden
evidence. A billow, the last messenger of the storm,
burst into the little bay, filled it to the brim with foam, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
tossed me far forward. It rolled back, dragging with it the
sedge and pebbles of the beach. I grasped the trunk of an
olive, rough and firm as the rock itself. The retiring waves
left me; I felt my way some paces among the trees, cast myself
down, and, worn out with fatigue, had scarcely reached
their shade when I fainted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Quiet Spot</div>

<p>I awoke in the decline of the day, as I could perceive by
the yellow and orange hues that colored the thick branches
above me. I was lying in a delicious recess, crowded with
fruit-trees; my bed was the turf, but it was soft as down; a
solitary nightingale above my head was sending forth snatches
of that melody which night prolongs into the very voice of
sweetness and sorrow; and a balmy air from the wild thyme
and blossoms of the rose breathed soothingly even to the
mind.</p>

<p>I had been thrown on one of the little isles that lie off Anthædon,
a portion of the Philistine territory before it was
won by our hero the Maccabee. The commerce which once
filled the arm of the sea near Gaza had perished in the change
of masters, and silence and seclusion reigned in a spot formerly
echoing with the tumult of merchant and mariner. The
little isle, the favorite retreat of the opulent Greek and Syrian
traders in the overpowering heats of summer, and cultivated
with the lavish expenditure of commercial wealth, now gave
no proof of its ever having felt the foot of man, but in the
spontaneous exuberance of flowers, once brought from every
region of the East and West, and the exquisite fruits that
still glowed on its slopes and dells.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Refuge</div>

<p>In all things else Nature had resumed her rights; the gilded
pavilions, the temples of Parian and Numidian stone, were in
ruins, and buried under a carpet of roses and myrtles. The
statues left but here and there a remnant of themselves, a
lovely relic, wreathed over in fantastic spirals by the clematis
and other climbing plants. The sculptured fountain let its
waters loose over the ground, and the guardian genius that
hung in marble beauty over the spring had long since resigned
his charge and lay mutilated and discolored with the
air and the dew. But the spring still gushed, bounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
bright between the gray fissures of the cliff, and marking its
course through the plain by the richer mazes of green.</p>

<p>To me, who was as weary of existence as ever was galley-slave,
this spot of quiet loveliness had a tenfold power. My
mind, like my body, longed for rest.</p>

<p>Through life I had walked in a thorny path; my ambition
had winged a tempestuous atmosphere. Useless hazards, wild
projects, bitter sufferings, were my portion. Those feelings
in which alone I could be said to live had all been made
inlets of pain. The love which nature and justice won from
me to my family was perpetually thwarted by a chain of
circumstances that made me a wretched, helpless, and solitary
man. What then could I do better than abandon the
idle hope of finding happiness among mankind; break off the
trial, which must be prolonged only to my evil; and elude the
fate that destined me to be an exile in the world? Yes, I
would no longer be a man of suffering, in the presence of its
happiness; a wretch stripped of an actual purpose, or a
solid hope, in the midst of its activity and triumph; the abhorred
example of a career miserable with defeated pursuit,
and tantalized with expectations vain as the ripple on the
stream!</p>

<p>In this stern resolve, gathering courage from despair—as
the criminal on the scaffold scoffs at the world that rejects
him—I determined to exclude recollection. The spot round
me was henceforth to fill up the whole measure of my
thoughts. Wife, children, friends, country, to me must exist
no more. I imaged them in the tomb; I talked with them as
shadows, as the graceful and lovely existences of ages past,—as
hallowed memorials; but labored to divest them of the individual
features that cling to the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the Shores of the Mediterranean</div>

<p>Lest this mystic repose should be disturbed by any of the
sights of living man, I withdrew deeper into the shades
which first sheltered me. It was enough for me that there
was a canopy of leaves above to shield my limbs from the
casual visitations of a sky whose sapphire looked scarcely
capable of a stain, and that the turf was soft for my couch.
Fruits sufficient to tempt the most luxurious taste were falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
round me, and the waters of the bright rivulet, scooped
in the rind of citron and orange, were a draft that the epicure
might envy. I was still utterly ignorant on what shore
of the Mediterranean I was thrown, further than that the sun
rose behind my bower and threw his western luster on the
waveless expanse of sea that spread before it to the round
horizon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Activity</div>

<p>But no man can be a philosopher against nature. With my
strength the desire for exertion returned. My most voluptuous
rest became irksome. Memory would not be restrained; the
floodgates of thought opened once more, and to resist the
passion for the world, I was driven to the drudgery of the
hands. I gathered wood for the winter’s fuel, in the midst
of days when the sun poured fire from the heavens; I attempted
to build a hut, beside grottoes that a hermit would
love; I trained trees and cultivated flowers where the soil
threw out all that was rich in both with exhaustless prodigality.</p>

<p>Yet no expedient would appease the passion for the absorbing
business of the world. My bower lost its enchantment;
the delight of lying on beds of violet, and with my
eyes fixed on the heavens, wandering away in rich illusion,
palled upon me; the colors of the vision had grown dim.
I no longer saw shapes of beauty winging their way through
the celestial azure; I heard no harmonies of spirits on the
midnight winds; I followed no longer the sun, rushing on his
golden chariot-wheels to lands unstained by human step, or
plunged with him at eve into the depths and ranged the secret
wonders of ocean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Island Prison</div>

<p>Labor in its turn grew irksome. I began to reproach myself
for the vulgar existence which occupied only the inferior
portion of my nature; living only for food, sleep, and shelter,
what was I better than the seals that basked on the shore at
my feet? Night, too—that mysterious rest, interposed for
purposes of such varied beneficence: to cool the brain, fevered
by the bustle of the day; to soften mutual hostility, by a
pause to which all alike must yield; to remind our forgetful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
nature, by a perpetual semblance, of the time when all things
must pass away, and be silent, and sleep; to sit in judgment
on our hearts, and by a decision which no hypocrisy can disguise,
anticipate the punishment of the villain, as it gives the
man of virtue the foretaste of his reward—night began to exert
its old influence over me; and with the strongest determination
to think no more of what had been, I closed my
eyes but to let in the past. I might have said that my true
sleep was during the labors of the day, and my waking when
I lay, with my senses sealed, upon my bed of leaves.</p>

<p>It is impossible to shut up the mind, and I at last abandoned
the struggle. The spell of indolence once broken, I
became as restless as an eagle in a cage. My first object was
to discover on what corner of the land I was thrown. Nothing
could be briefer than the circuit of my island, and nothing
less explanatory. It was one of those little alluvial spots that
grow round the first rock that catches the vegetation swept
down by rivers. Ages had gone by, while reed was bound to
reed and one bed of clay laid upon another. The ocean had
thrown up its sands on the shore; the winds had sown tree
and herb on the naked sides of the tall rock; the tree had
drawn the cloud, and from its roots let loose the spring.
Cities and empires had perished while this little island was
forming into loveliness. Thus nature perpetually builds,
while decay does its work with the pomp of man. From the
shore I saw but a long line of yellow sand across a broad belt
of blue waters. No sight on earth could less attract the eye
or be less indicative of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unanswered Signals</div>

<p>Yet within that sandy barrier what wild and wondrous acts
might be doing, and to be done! My mind, with a pinion
that no sorrow or bondage could tame, passed over the desert,
and saw the battle, the siege, the bloody sedition, the long
and heart-broken banishment, the fierce conflict of passions
irrestrainable as the tempest, the melancholy ruin of my
country by a judgment powerful as fate, and dreary and returnless
as the grave! But the waters between me and that
shore were an obstacle that no vigor of imagination could
overcome. I was too feeble to attempt the passage by swimming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
The opposite coast appeared to be uninhabited, and
the few fishing-boats that passed lazily along this lifeless
coast evidently shunned the island, as I conceived, from some
hidden shoal. I felt myself a prisoner, and the thought irritated
me. That ancient disturbance of my mind, which rendered
it so keenly excitable, was born again; I felt its coming,
and knew that my only resource was to escape from this
circumscribing paradise that had become my dungeon. Day
after day I paced the shore, awaking the echoes with my useless
shouts, as each distant sail glided along close to the sandy
line that was now to me the unattainable path of happiness.
I made signals from the hill, but I might as well have summoned
the vultures to stop as they flew screaming above my
head to feed on the relics of the Syrian caravans.</p>

<p>What trifles can sometimes stand between man and enjoyment!
Wisdom would have thanked Heaven for the hope of
escaping the miseries of life in the little enchanted round,
guarded by that entrenchment of waters, filled with every
production that could delight the sense, and giving to the
spirit, weary of all that the world could offer, the gentle retirement
in which it could gather its remaining strength and
make its peace with Heaven.</p>

<p>I was lying during a fiery noon on the edge of the island,
looking toward the opposite coast, the only object on which I
could now bear to look, when, in the stillness of the hour, I
heard a strange mingling of distant sounds, yet so totally indistinct
that, after long listening, I could conjecture it to be
nothing but the rising of the surge. It died away. But it
haunted me: I heard it in fancy. It followed me in the
morn, the noon, and the twilight; in the hour of toil and in
the hour when earth and heaven were soft and silent as an
infant’s sleep—when the very spirit of tranquillity seemed to
be folding his dewy wings over the world.</p>

<p>Wearied more with thought than with the daily toil that I
imposed on myself for its cure, I had one night wandered to
the shore, and lain down under the shelter of those thick
woven boughs that scarcely let in the glimpses of the moon.
The memory of all whom later chances brought in my path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
passed before me—the fate of my gallant kinsmen in Masada,
of the wily Ishmaelite, of the pirate captain, of that unhappy
crew whose danger was my involuntary deed, of my family
scattered upon the face of the world. Arcturus, bending
toward the horizon, told me that it was already midnight,
when my reverie was broken by the same sounds that had
once disturbed my day. But they now came full and distinct.
I heard the crashing of heavy axles along the road,
the measured tramp of cavalry, the calls of the clarion and
trumpet. They seemed beside me. I started from my sand,
but all around was still. I gazed across the waters; they
were lying, like another sky, reflecting star for star with the
blue immensity above—but on them was no living thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Leaves His
Shelter</div>

<p>I had heard of phantom armies traversing the air, but the
sky was serene as crystal. I climbed the hill, upon whose
summit I recollected to have seen the ruins of an altar; gathered
the weeds, and lighted them for a beacon. The flame
threw a wide and ruddy reflection on the waters and the sky.
I watched by it until morn. But the sound had died as
rapidly as it rose; and when, with the first pearly tinge of
the east, the coast shaped itself beneath my eye, I saw with
bitter disappointment but the same solitary shore. The idea
of another day of suspense was intolerable; I returned to my
place of refuge; gave it that glance of mingled feeling, without
which perhaps no man leaves the shelter which he is never
to see again; collected a few fruits for my sustenance, if I
should reach the desert; and with a resolution to perish, if it
so pleased Providence, but not to return, plunged into the
sea.</p>

<p>The channel was even broader than I had calculated by the
eye. My limbs were still enfeebled, but my determination
was strength. I was swept by the current far from the opposite
curve of the shore; yet its force spared mine, and after
a long struggle I felt the ground under my feet. I was overjoyed,
tho never was scene less fitted for joy. To the utmost
verge of the view spread the sands, a sullen herbless
waste, glowing like a sheet of brass in the almost vertical sun.</p>

<p>But I was on land! I had accomplished my purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Hope, the power of exertion, the chances of glorious future
life, were before me. I was no longer a prisoner, within the
borders of a spot which, for all the objects of manly existence,
might as well have been my grave.</p>

<p>I journeyed on by sun and star in that direction which, to
the Jew, is an instinct—to Jerusalem. Yet what fearful reverses,
in this time of confusion, might not have occurred
even there! What certainty could I have of being spared the
bitterest losses, when sorrow and slaughter reigned through
the land? Was I to be protected from the storm, that fell
with such promiscuous fury upon all? I, too, the marked,
the victim, the example to mankind! I looked wistfully back
to the isle—that isle of oblivion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Robber
Camp</div>

<p>While I was pacing the sand that actually scorched my
feet, I heard a cry, and saw on a low range of sand-hills, at
some distance, a figure making violent gestures. Friend or
enemy, at least here was man, and I did not deeply care for
the consequences, even of meeting man in his worst shape.
Hunger and thirst might be more formidable enemies in the
end; and I advanced toward the half-naked savage, who,
however, ran from me, crying out louder than ever. I
dragged my weary limbs after him, and at length reached the
edge of a little dell in which stood a circle of tents. I had
fallen among the robbers of the desert, but there was evident
confusion in this fragment of a tribe. The camels were in
the act of being loaded; men and women were gathering their
household matters with the haste of terror; and dogs, sheep,
camels, and children set up their voices in a general clamor.</p>

<p>Dreading that I might lose my only chance of refreshment
and guidance, I cried out with all my might, and hastened
down toward them; but the sight of me raised a universal
scream, and every living thing took flight, the horsemen of
the colony gallantly leading the way, with a speed that soon
left the pedestrians far in the rear. But their invader conquered
only for food. I entered the first of the deserted tents,
and indulged myself with a full feast of bread, dry and rough
as the sand on which it was baked, and of water, only less
bitter than that through which I had swum. Still, all luxury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
is relative. To me they were both delicious, and I thanked
at once the good fortune which had provided so prodigally for
those withered monarchs of the sands, and had invested my
raggedness with the salutary terror that gave me the fruits
of triumph without the toil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Girl’s
Appearance</div>

<p>At the close of my feast, I uttered a few customary words
of thanksgiving. A cry of joy rang in my ears; I looked
round; saw, to my surprise, a bale of carpets walk forward
from a corner of the tent, and heard a Jewish tongue imploring
for life and freedom. I rapidly developed the speaker,
and from this repulsive overture came forth one of the loveliest
young females that I had ever seen. Her story was soon
told. She was the granddaughter of Ananus,<a name="ENanchor_41" id="ENanchor_41"></a><a href="#Endnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> the late high
priest, one of the most distinguished of his nation for every
lofty quality; but he had fallen on evil days. His resistance
to faction sharpened the dagger against him, and he perished
in one of the merciless feuds of the city. His only descendant
was now before me; she had been sent to claim the protection
of her relatives in the south of Judea. But her escort
was dispersed by an attack of the Arabs, and in the division
of the spoil the sheik of this little encampment obtained her
as his share. The robber merchant was on his way to Cæsarea
to sell his prize to the Roman governor, when my arrival
put his caravan to the rout. To my inquiry into the
cause of this singular success, the fair girl answered that the
Arabs had taken me for a supernatural visitant, “probably
come to claim some account of their proceedings in the late
expedition.” They had been first startled by the blaze in the
island, which by a tradition of the desert was said to be the
dwelling of forbidden beings. My passage of the channel was
seen, and increased the wonder; my daring to appear alone,
among men whom mankind shunned, completed the belief of
my more than mortal prowess, and the Arabs’ courage abandoned
a contest in which “the least that could happen to them
was to be swept into the surge, or tossed piecemeal upon the
winds.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sheik’s Shekels</div>

<p>To prevent the effects of their returning intrepidity, no time
was to be lost in our escape. But the sun, which would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
scorched anything but a lizard or a Bedouin to death, kept
us prisoners until evening. We were actively employed in
the mean time. The plunder of the horde was examined, with
the curiosity that makes one of the indefeasible qualities
of the fair in all climates; and the young Jewess had not been
an inmate of the tent, nor possessed the brightest eyes among
the daughters of women, for nothing. With an air between
play and revenge, she hunted out every recess in which even
the art of Arab thievery could dispose of its produce; and at
length rooted up from a hole in the very darkest corner of the
tent that precious deposit for which the sheik would have sacrificed
all mankind, and even the last hair of his beard—a bag
of shekels. She danced with exultation as she poured the
shining contents on the ground before me.</p>

<p>“If ever Arab regretted his capture,” said she, “this most
unlucky of sheiks shall have cause. But I shall teach him at
least one virtue—repentance to the last hour of his life. I
think that I see him at this moment frightened into a philosopher,
and wishing from the bottom of his soul that he had,
for once, resisted the temptation of his trade.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do with the money, my pretty teacher
of virtue to Arabs?”</p>

<p>“Give it to my preserver,” said she, advancing, with a look
suddenly changed from sportiveness to blushing timidity;
“give it to him who was sent by Providence to rescue a
daughter of Israel from the hands of the heathen.”</p>

<p>In the emotion of gratitude to me there was mingled a
loftier feeling, never so lovely as in youth and woman; she
threw up a single glance to heaven, and a tear of piety filled
her sparkling eye.</p>

<p>“But, temptress and teacher at once,” said I, “by what
right am I to seize on the sheik’s treasury? May it not diminish
my supernatural dignity with the tribe to be known
as a plunderer?”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said she, with a rosy smile; “who is to betray you
but your accomplice? Besides, money is reputation and innocence,
wisdom and virtue, all over the world.”</p>

<p>Touching, with the tip of one slender finger, my arm as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
lay folded on my bosom, she waved the other hand, in attitudes
of untaught persuasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Maiden’s
Philosophy</div>

<p>“Is it not true,” pleaded the pretty creature, “that next to a
crime of our own is the being a party to the crime of others?
Now, for what conceivable purpose could the Arab have collected
this money? Not for food or clothing; for he can eat
thistles with his own camel, and nature has furnished him
with clothing as she has furnished the bear. The haik is only
an encumbrance to his impenetrable skin. What, then, can
he do with money but mischief, fit out new expeditions, and
capture other fair maidens, who can not hope to find spirits,
good or bad, for their protectors? If we leave him the means
of evil, what is it but doing the evil ourselves? So,” concluded
this resistless pleader, carefully gathering up the spoil
and putting it into my hands, “I have gained my cause, and
have now only to thank my most impartial judge for his patient
hearing.”</p>

<p>There is a magic in woman. No man, not utterly degraded,
can listen without delight to the accents of her guileless heart.
Beauty, too, has a natural power over the mind, and it is right
that this should be. All that overcomes selfishness—the besetting
sin of the world—is an instrument of good. Beauty
is but melody of a higher kind, and both alike soften the
troubled and hard nature of man. Even if we looked on
lovely woman but as on a rose, an exquisite production of the
summer hours of life, it would be idle to deny her influence
in making even those summer hours sweeter. But as the
companion of the mind, as the very model of a friendship
that no chance can shake, as the pleasant sharer of the heart
of heart, the being to whom man returns after the tumult of
the day, like the worshiper to a secret shrine, to revive his
nobler tastes and virtues at a source pure from the evil of the
external world, where shall we find her equal, or what must
be our feelings toward the mighty Disposer of earth, and all
that inhabit it, but of admiration and gratitude for that disposal
which thus combines our fondest happiness with our
purest virtue?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Philosopher’s
Place</div>

<p>The evening came at last; the burning calm was followed
by a breeze breathing of life, and on the sky sailed, as if it
were wafted by that gentle breeze, the evening star. The
lifeless silence of the desert now began to be broken by a
variety of sounds, wild and sad enough in themselves, but
softening by distance, and not ill suited to that declining hour
which is so natural an emblem of the decline of life. The
moaning of the shepherd’s horn; the low of the folding herds;
the long, deep cry of the camel; even the scream of the vulture
wheeling home from some recent wreck on the shore, and
the howl of the jackal venturing out on the edge of dusk, came
with no unpleasing melancholy upon the wind. We stood gazing
impatiently from the tent door, at the west, that still
glowed like a furnace of molten gold.</p>

<p>“Will that sun never go down?” I exclaimed. “We must
wait his leisure, and he seems determined to tantalize us.”</p>

<p>“Yes; like a rich old man, determined to try the patience
of his heirs, and more tenacious of his wealth the more his
powers of enjoyment decay,” said the Jewess.</p>

<p>“Philosophy from those young lips! Yet the desert is the
place for a philosopher.”</p>

<p>“That I deny,” said my sportive companion. “Philosophy
is good for nothing where it has nothing to ridicule, and where
it will be neither fed nor flattered. Its true place is the world,
as much as the true place of yonder falcon is wherever it can
find anything to pounce upon. Here your philosopher must
labor for himself and laugh at himself—an indulgence in
which he is the most temperate of men. In short, he is fit
only for the idle, gay, ridiculous, and timid world. The desert
is the soil for a much nobler plant. If you would train a
poet into flower, set him here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>“Or a plunderer.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. They are sometimes much the same.”</p>

<p>“Yet the desert produces nothing—but Arabs.”</p>

<p>“There are some minds, even among Arabs, and some of
their rhapsodies are beauty itself. The very master of this
tent, who fought and killed, I dare not say how many, to secure
so precious a prize as myself, and who, after all his
heroism, would have sold me into slavery for life, spent half
his evenings sitting at this door chanting to every star of
heaven, and riming, with tears in his eyes, to all kinds of
tender remembrances.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps he was a genius, a heaven-born accident, and
his merit was the more in being a genius in the midst of such
a scene.”</p>

<p>“No—everything round us this hour is poetry. The silence—those
broken sounds that make the silence more striking as
they decay—those fiery continents of cloud, the empire of that
greatest of sheiks, the sun, lord of the red desert of the air—the
immeasurable desert below. Vastness, obscurity, and terror,
the three spirits that work the profoundest wonders of the
poet, are here in their native region. And now,” she said,
with a look that showed there were other spells than poetry
to be found in the desert, “to release you, I know, by signs
infallible, that the sun is setting.”</p>

<p>I could not avoid laughing at the mimic wisdom with which
she announced her discovery, and asked whence she had acquired
the faculty of solving such rare problems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Daughter of
the Desert</div>

<p>“Oh, by my incomparable knowledge of the stars.” She
pointed to the eastern sky, on which they began to cluster in
showers of diamond. “I have to thank the desert for it;
and,” she added, with a slight submission of voice, “for everything.
I am a daughter of the desert; the first sight that I
saw was a camel; my early, my only accomplishments were
to ride, sing Bedouin songs, tell Bedouin stories, and tame
a young panther. But my history draws to a close. While
I was supreme in the graces of a savage, had learned to sit a
dromedary, throw the lance, make haiks, and gallop for a
week together, love, resistless love, came in my way. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
son of a sheik, heir to a hundred quarrels and ten thousand
sheep, goats, and horses, claimed me as his natural prey. I
shrank from a husband even more accomplished than myself,
and was meditating how to make my escape, whether into the
wilderness or into the bottom of the sea, when a summons
came which, or the money that came with it, the sheik found
irresistible. And now my history is at an end.”</p>

<p>“And so,” said I, to provoke her to the rest of her narrative,
“your story ends, as usual, with marriage. You, of
course, finding that you had nothing to prevent your leaving
the desert, took the female resolution of remaining in it, and
as you might discard the young sheik at your pleasure, refused
to have any other human being.”</p>

<p>“Can you think me capable of such a horror?”</p>

<p>She stamped her little foot in indignation on the ground;
then turning on me with her flashing eye, penetrated the
stratagem at once by my smile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naomi
Continues Her
Story</div>

<p>“Then hear the rest. I instantly mounted my dromedary,
galloped for three days without sleep, and at length saw the
towers of Jerusalem—glorious Jerusalem. I passed through
crowds that seemed to me a gathering of the world; streets
that astonished me with a thousand strange sights; and,
overwhelmed with magnificence, delight, and fatigue, arrived
at a palace, where I was met by a host of half-adoring domestics,
and was led to the most venerable and beloved of
wise and holy men, who caught me to his heart, called me his
Naomi, his child, his hope, and shed tears and blessings on
my head, as the sole survivor of his illustrious line.” She
burst into tears.</p>

<p>The recollection of the good and heroic high priest was
strong with us both, and in silence I suffered her sorrows to
have their way. A faint echo of horns and voices roused me.</p>

<p>“Look to the hills!” I exclaimed, as I saw a long black line
creeping, like a march of ants, down the side of a distant
ridge of sand.</p>

<p>“Those are our Arabs,” said she, without a change of countenance.
“They are, of course, coming to see what the angel,
or demon, who visited them to-day has left in witness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
presence. But from what I overheard of their terrors, no
Arab will venture near the tents till night; night, the general
veil of the iniquities of this amusing and very wicked world.”</p>

<p>“Yet how shall we traverse the sands on foot?”</p>

<p>“Forbid it, the spirit of romance,” said she. “I must see
whether the gallantry of the sheik has not provided against
that misfortune.”</p>

<p>She flew into the tent, and, drawing back a curtain, showed
me two mares, of the most famous breed of Arabia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spirited
Steeds</div>

<p>“Here are the Koshlani,” said she, with playful malice
dancing in her eyes; “I saw them brought in, in triumph,
last night, stolen from the pastures of Achmet Ben Ali himself,
first horse-stealer and prince of the Bedouins, who is
doubtless by this time half dead of grief at the loss of the two
gems of his stud. I heard the achievement told with great
rejoicings, and a very curious specimen of dexterity it was.
Come forth,” said she, leading out two beautiful animals,
white as milk; “come forth, you two lovely orphans of the
true breed of Solomon—princesses with pedigrees that put
kings to shame, unless they can go back two thousand years;
birds of the Bedouin, with wings to your feet, stars for
eyes, and ten times the sense of your masters in your little
tossing heads.”</p>

<p>She sprang upon her courser, and winded it with the delight
of practised skill. The Arabs were now but a few miles off
and in full gallop toward us. I urged her to ride away at
once, but she continued curveting and maneuvering her spirited
steed, that, enjoying the free air of the desert after
having been shut up so long, threw up its red nostrils and
bounded like a stag.</p>

<p>“A moment yet,” said she; “I have not quite done with
the Arab. It is certainly bad treatment for his hospitality to
have plundered him of his dinner, his money, and his horses.”</p>

<p>“And of his captive, a loss beyond all reparation.”</p>

<p>“I perfectly believe so,” was the laughing answer; “but I
have been thinking of making him a reparation which any
Arab on earth would think worth even my charms. I have
been contriving how to make his fortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>“By returning his shekels?”</p>

<p>“Not a grain of them shall he ever see. No, he shall not
have the sorrow to think that he entertained only a princess
and a philosopher. As a spirit you came, and as a spirit you
shall depart, and he shall have the honor of telling the tale.
The national stories of such matters are worn out; he shall
have a new one of his own, and every emir in the kingdoms
of Ishmael—through the fiery sands of Ichama, the riverless
mountains of Nejd; Hejaz, the country of flies and fools; and
Yemen, the land of locusts, lawyers, and merchants, will rejoice
to have him at his meal. Thus the man’s fortune is
made, for there is no access to the heart like that of being
necessary to the dinners and dulness of the mighty.”</p>

<p>“Or on the strength of the wonder,” said I, “he may make
wonders of his own, turn charlatan of the first magnitude,
profess to cure the incurable, and get solid gold for empty
pretension; sell health to the epicure, gaiety to the old, and
charms to the repulsive; defy the course of nature, and live
like a prince upon the exhaustless revenue of human absurdity.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Blazing
Tents</div>

<p>A cloud of smoke now wreathed up from the sheik’s tent;
fire followed; and even while we looked on, the wind, carrying
the burning fragments, set the whole camp in a blaze.
The Arabs gave a universal shriek and fled back, scattering
with gestures and cries of terror through the sands.</p>

<p>“There—there,” said my companion, clapping her delicate
white palms in exultation; “let them beware of making women
captives in future. In my final visit to the tent I put a
firebrand into the very bundle of carpets in which I played
the part of slave.”</p>

<p>“Not to be your representative, I presume.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forward!</div>

<p>“Yes, with only the distinction that in time I should have
been much the more perilous of the two. If that unlucky
sheik had dared to keep me a week longer in his detestable
tent, I should have raised a rebellion in the tribe, dethroned
him, and turned princess on my own account. As to burning
him out, there was no remedy. But for those flames the tribe
would have been upon our road. But for those flames we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
might even have been mistaken for mere mortals; and your
spirits always vanish as we do, in fire and smoke. How
nobly those tents blaze! Now, forward!”</p>

<p>She gave the reins to her barb, flung a triumphant gesture
toward the burning camp, and under cover of a huge sheet of
fiery vapor we darted into the wilderness.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Before Masada</i></span></h3>

<p>Our flight lay toward Masada. The stars were brilliant
guides, and the coolness of the Arabian night, which forms so
singular a contrast to the overpowering ardors of the day, relieved
us from the chief obstacle of desert travel. At daybreak
we reached a tract, whose broken and burnt-up ground
showed that there had lately encamped the army the sound of
whose march had startled my reveries in the island.</p>

<p>It was evening when I caught the glimpse of the fortress.
My heart trembled at the sight. An impression of evil was
upon me. Yet I must go on or die.</p>

<p>“There,” said I, “you see my home, and yours while you
desire it. You will find friends delighted to receive you, and
a protection that neither Roman nor Arab can insult. Heaven
grant that all may be as when I left Masada!”</p>

<p>The fair girl gratefully thanked me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naomi’s
Gratitude</div>

<p>“I have been long,” said she, “unused to kindness, and its
voice overpowers me. But if the duty, the gratitude, the
faithful devotedness of the orphan to her generous preserver
can deserve protection, I shall yet have some claim. Suffer
me to be your daughter.”</p>

<p>She bowed her head before me with filial reverence. I took
the outstretched hand, that quivered in mine, and pressed it
to my lips. The sacred compact was pledged in the sight of
the stars. More formal treaties have been made, but few sincerer.</p>

<p>We rapidly advanced to the foot of the ridge that, now defining
and extending, showed its well-known features in all
their rugged grandeur. But to come within reach of the
gates, I had still one of the huge buttresses of the mountain
to go round. My companion, with the quick sympathy that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
makes one of the finest charms of women, already shared in
my ominous fears, and rode by my side without a word. My
eyes were fixed on the ground. I was roused by a clash of
warlike music. The suspense was terribly at an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Signs
of Defeat</div>

<p>The spears of a legion were moving in a glittering line
down the farther declivity. Squadrons of horses in marching
order were drawn up on the plain. The baggage of a little
army lay under the eye, waiting for the escort now descending
from the fortress. The story of my ruin was told in that
single glance. All was lost!</p>

<p>The walls of the citadel, breached in every direction, gave
signs of a long siege. The White Stag of Naphtali no longer
lifted its blazon on the battlements; dismantling and desolation
were there. But what horrors must have been wrought
before the Romans could shake the strength of those walls!</p>

<p>First and most fearful, what had been the fate of Miriam
and my children? In what grave was I to look for my noble
brother and my kinsmen?</p>

<p>Conscious that to stay was to give myself and my trembling
companion to the cruel mercy of Rome, I yet was unable to
leave the spot. I hovered round it, as the spirit might hover
round the tomb. Maddening with bitter yearnings of heart,
that intense eagerness to know the worst which is next to
despair, I spurred up the steep by an obscure path that led
me to a postern. There was no sound within. I dashed
through the streets. Not a living being was to be seen; piles
of firewood lighted under the principal buildings and at the
gates showed that the fortress was destined to immediate
overthrow. War had done its worst. The broad, sanguine
plashes on the pavements showed that the battle had been
fought, long and desperately, within the walls. The famous
armory was a heap of ashes. Ditches dug across the streets
and strewed with broken weapons, and the white remnants of
what once was man; walls raised within walls, and now broken
down; stately houses loopholed and turned into little fortresses;
fragments of noble architecture blocking up the
breaches; graves dug in every spot where the spade could
open a few feet of ground; fragments of superb furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
lying half burnt where the defenders had been forced out by
conflagration—all gave sad evidence of the struggle of brave
men against overpowering numbers.</p>

<p>But where were they who had made the prize so dear to the
conquerors? Was I treading on the clay that once breathed
patriotism and love? Did the wreck on which I leaned, as I
gazed round this mighty mausoleum, cover the earthly tenement
of my kinsmen, and, still dearer, the last of my name?
Was I treading on the grave of those gentle and lovely natures
for whose happiness I would rejoicingly have laid down
the scepter of the world?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Meets Jubal</div>

<p>In my agitation I cried aloud. My voice rang through the
solitude round me, and returned on the ear with a startling
distinctness. But living sounds suddenly mingled with the
echo. A low groan came from a pile of ruins beside me. I
listened, as one might listen for an answer from the sepulcher.
The voice was heard again. A few stones from the shattered
wall gave way, and I saw thrust out the withered, bony hand
of a human being. I tore down the remaining impediments,
and beheld pale, emaciated, and at the point of death by famine,
my friend, my fellow soldier, my fellow sufferer—Jubal!</p>

<p>Joy is sometimes as dangerous as sorrow. He gave a
glance of recognition, struggled forward, and, uttering a wild
cry, fell senseless into my arms. On his recovering, before
I could ask him the question nearest my heart, it was answered.</p>

<p>“They are safe—all safe,” said he. “On the landing of
fresh troops from Italy, the first efforts of the legions were
directed against the fortress. The pirates, in return for the
victory to which you led them, had set me at liberty. I made
my way through the enemy’s posts; Eleazar, ever generous
and noble, received me, after all my wanderings, with the
heart of a father, and we determined on defending this glorious
trophy of your heroism, to the last man. But with the
wisdom that never failed him, he knew what must be the result,
and at the very commencement of the siege sent your
family away to Alexandria, where they might be sure of protection
from our kindred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Family</div>

<p>“And they went by sea?” I asked shudderingly, while the
whole terrible truth dawned upon my mind. They were in
the fleet which I had followed.</p>

<p>“It was the only course. The country was filled with the
enemy.”</p>

<p>“Then they are lost! Wretched father, now no father!—man
marked by destiny!—the blow has fallen at last! They
perished—I saw them perish. Their dying shrieks rang in
these ears. I was their destroyer. From first to last I have
been their undoing!”</p>

<p>Jubal looked on me with astonishment. My adopted
daughter, without any idle attempt at consolation, only
bathed my hand with her tears.</p>

<p>“There must be some misconception in all this,” said
Jubal. “Before we left that accursed dungeon, they had
embarked with a crowd of females from the surrounding
country in one of the annual fleets for Egypt. Before we
sailed from the pirates’ cavern they were probably safe in
Alexandria.”</p>

<p>“No! I saw them perish. I heard their dying cry. I
drove them to destruction,” was the only answer that my
withering lips could utter. I remembered the horrors of the
storm; the desperate efforts of the merchant galley to escape;
its fatal disappearance. Faintly, and with many a successive
agony, I gave the melancholy reasons for my belief. My
auditors listened with fear and trembling.</p>

<p>“There is now no use in sorrow,” said Jubal sternly, “and
as little in struggle. I too have lived until the light that
brightened my dreary hours is extinguished. I too have
known the extremities of passion. If suffering could have
atoned for my offenses, I have suffered. A thousand years
of existence could not teach me more. Here let us die.”</p>

<p>He unsheathed his poniard.</p>

<p>My young companion, in the anxiety of the moment, forgetting
the presence of a stranger, flung back the veil which
had hitherto covered her face and figure, and clasping my
raised arm, said in a tone so low, yet penetrating, that it
seemed the whisper of my own conscience:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Naomi’s
Reprimand</div>

<p>“Has death no fears?” She fixed her eyes on me and
waited breathlessly for the answer.</p>

<p>“Daughter of beauty,” said Jubal, as a smile of admiration
played on his sad features, “thoughts like ours are not for the
lovely and the young. May the Heaven that has stamped
that countenance be your protection through many a year!
But to the weary, rest is happiness, not terror. Prince of
Naphtali, this fair maiden’s presence forbids darker thoughts;
we must speed her on her way to security before we can think
of ourselves and our misfortunes.”</p>

<p>“The daughter of Ananus,” said she, in atone of heroic
pride, “has no earthly fears. The boldest warrior of Israel
never died more boldly than that venerable parent. Within
his sacred robes was the heart of a soldier, a patriot, and a
king. Let me die for a cause like his; at the foot of the
altar, let my blood be poured out for my country; let this
feeble form sink in the ruins of the Temple, and death will
be of all welcome things the most welcome. But I would not
die for a fantasy, for idleness, for nothing. Put up that
weapon, warrior, and let us go forth and see whether great
things are not yet to be done.”</p>

<p>She significantly pointed toward Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“It is too late,” said Jubal, glancing with a sigh at his own
wasted form.</p>

<p>“What?” said the heroine; “is it too late to be virtuous,
but not too late to be guilty? Too late to resist the enemies of
our country, but not too late to make ourselves worthless to
our holy cause? If Heaven demands an account of every
wasted talent and misspent hour, what fearful account will
be theirs who make all talents and all hours useless at a
blow?”</p>

<p>“Maiden, you have not known what it is to lose everything
that made earth a place of hope,” said I, gazing with wonder
and pity on the fine enthusiasm that the world is so fatally
empowered to destroy. “May not the tired traveler hasten
to the end of his journey without a crime?”</p>

<p>“May not the slave,” said Jubal, “weary of his chain, escape
unchidden from his captivity?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Words of
Wisdom</div>

<p>“And may not the soldier quit his post when caprice disgusts
him with his duty?” was the maiden’s answer, with a
lofty look. “Or, may not the child break loose from the place
of instruction and plead his dislike to discipline? As well
may man, placed here for the service of the highest of beings,
plead his own narrow will against the supreme command,
daringly charge Heaven with the injustice of setting him a
task above his strength, and madly insult Its power under
the pretext of relying on Its compassion.”</p>

<p>She paused, as if surprised at her own earnestness, and
blushing, said: “This wisdom is not my own. It was the
last gift of an illustrious parent, when in my agony at the
sight of his mortal wounds I longed to follow him. ‘Live,’
said he, ‘while you can live with virtue. The God who has
placed us on earth best knows when and how to recall us. If
self-destruction were no crime in one instance, it would be no
crime to universal mankind; the whole frame of society would
be overthrown by a permission to evade its duties on the easy
penalty of dying. Our obligations to country, family, man,
and Heaven would be perpetually flung off, if they were to
be held at the caprice of human nature.’”</p>

<p>Jubal looked intently on the young oracle, and tho bending
with Oriental deference, was yet unconvinced.</p>

<p>“Is there to be no end to the mind’s anxiety but the tardy
decay of the frame? Is there no time for the return of the
exile, or what is this very feeling of despair but a voice within—an
unwritten command to die?”</p>

<p>Naomi turned to me with a look imploring my aid. But
I was broken down by the tidings that had now reached me.
Jubal wrapped his cloak round him, and was striding into the
shadow of the ruin. Naomi, terrified at the idea of death,
seized the corner of his mantle.</p>

<p>“Will you shrink from the evils of life,” she adjured,
“and yet have the dreadful courage to defy the wrath of
Heaven? Shall worms like us, shall creatures covered with
weaknesses and sins, whose only hope must be in mercy, commit
a crime that by its very nature disclaims supplication and
makes repentance impossible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>With the energy of terror she threw back the folds of the
cloak and arrested the hand, with the dagger already uplifted.
She led back the reluctant, yet unresisting, step, and
said in a voice still trembling: “Prince of Naphtali, save
your brother!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naomi’s
Triumph</div>

<p>I held out my arms to Jubal; the sternness of his soul was
past, and he fell upon my neck. Naomi stood, exulting in
her triumph, with the countenance that an angel might wear
at the return of a sinner.</p>

<p>“Prince of Naphtali,” said she, “if those who were dear to
you have perished—which Heaven avert!—you may have been
thus but the more marked out for the instrument of solemn
services to Israel. The virtues that might have languished
in the happiness of home may be summoned into vigor for
mankind. Warrior,” and she turned her glowing smile on
Jubal, “this is not the time for valor and experience to shrink
from the side of our country. Perfidy may still be repelled
by patriotism; violence put down by wisdom; the power of
the people roused by the example of a hero; even the last
spark of life may be made splendid by mingling with the last
glories of the people of God.”</p>

<p>Jubal’s wasted cheek reddened with the theme; but his
emotion was too deep for language. He led the way; we
passed in silence through the deserted streets, and without seeing
the face of a human being, reached the dismantled gates
of Masada.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Among Roman Soldiers</i></span></h3>

<p>Jubal guided us down the declivities among ramparts and
trenches, and after long windings, where every step reminded
me of havoc, brought us to a little hamlet in the recesses of
the valley, so secluded that it seemed never to have heard the
sound of war. The thunder of the falling masses of fortification,
as the fire reached their props, kept us awake all night,
and I arose from my humble couch to breathe the delicious
air that makes the summer night of Asia the time of refreshment
alike to the frame and to the mind. I found Jubal
already abroad and gazing on the summit of the mountain,
where the sullen glare of the sky and the crash of buildings
showed that the work of devastation was rapidly going on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Details of a
Siege</div>

<p>He gave me some details of the siege. The Romans had
found the fortress so hazardous to the advance of their reenforcements
that its possession was essential to the conquest
of Judea. Cestius, my old antagonist, solicited the command
to wipe off his disgrace, and the whole force of the legions
was brought up. But the generalship of Eleazar and the
intrepidity of the garrison baffled every assault, with tremendous
loss of the enemy. The siege was next turned into
a blockade. Famine and disease were more formidable than
the sword; and the brave defenders were reduced to a number
scarcely able to man the walls.</p>

<p>“We now,” said Jubal, “fought the battle of despair; we
saw the enemy’s camp crowded every day with fresh troops,
and the provisions of the whole country brought among them
in profusion, while we had not a morsel to eat, while our
fountains ran dry, and while our few troops were harassed
with mortal fatigue. Yet no man thought of surrender.
Eleazar’s courage—a courage sustained by higher thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
than those of the soldier, the fortitude of piety and prayer—inspired
us all, and we went to our melancholy duties with
the calmness of men to whom the grave was inevitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Final
Attack</div>

<p>“At last, when our reduced numbers gave the enemy a
hope, we were attacked by their whole force. But, if they
expected to conquer us at their ease, never were they more
deceived. When the walls gave way before their machines,
they were fought from street to street, from house to house,
from chamber to chamber. Eleazar, as active as he was wise,
was everywhere; we fought in ruins—in fire. Multitudes of
the enemy perished, and more deaths were given by the knife
than the spear, for our arms were long since exhausted. The
last effort was made on the spot where you found me. When
every defense was mastered by the constant supply of fresh
troops, Eleazar, passing through the subterranean to attack
the Roman rear, left me in command of the few who survived.
We entrenched ourselves in the armory. For three days we
fought without tasting food, without an hour’s sleep, without
laying the weapons out of our hands. At length the final
assault was given. In the midst of it we heard shouts which
told us that our friends had made the concerted attack, but
we were too few and feeble to second it. The shouts died
away; we were overpowered, and my first sensation of returning
life was the combined agony of famine, wounds, and suffocation,
under the ruins that I then thought my living
grave.”</p>

<p>“By dawn,” said I, “we must set out for Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“It has been closely invested,” was the answer, “for the
last three months;<a name="ENanchor_42" id="ENanchor_42"></a><a href="#Endnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and famine and faction are doing their
worst within the walls. Titus is without, at the head of a
hundred thousand of the legionaries and auxiliaries. To enter
will be next to impossible, and when once entered, what
will be before you but the madness of civil discord, and
finally, death by the hands of an enemy utterly infuriated
against our nation?”</p>

<p>“To Jerusalem, at all risks,” I exclaimed; “my fate is
mingled with that of the last stronghold of our fallen people.
What matters it to one whose roots of happiness are cut up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
like mine, in what spot he struggles with man and fortune?
As a son of Judea my powers are due to her cause, and every
drop of my blood, shed for any other, would be treason to the
memory of my fathers. The dawn finds me on my way to
Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“Spoken like a prince of Naphtali,” sighed Jubal; “but there
I must not follow you. The course of glory is cut off for me;
alone, something may still be done by collecting the fugitives
of the tribes and harassing the Roman communications. But
Jerusalem, tho every stone of her walls is precious to my
soul, must not receive my guilty steps. I have horrid recollections
of things seen and done there. Onias, that wily
hypocrite, will be there to fill me with visions of terror.
There, too, are others.” He was silent, but suddenly resuming
his firmness: “I have no hostility to Constantius; I even
honor him; but my spirit is still too feverish to bear his presence—I
must live and die, far from all whom I have ever
known.”</p>

<p>He hid his face in his mantle, but the agitation of his form
showed his anguish, more than clamorous grief. He walked
forth into the darkness. I was ignorant of his purpose, and
lingered long for his return—I saw him no more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arrival of
Roman Cavalry</div>

<p>Disturbed and pained by his loss, I had scarcely thrown
myself on the cottage floor, my only bed, when I was roused
by the cries of the village. A squadron of Roman cavalry
marching to Jerusalem had entered, and was taking up its
quarters for the night. The peasantry could make no resistance,
and attempted none. I had only time to call to my
adopted daughter to rise, when our hut was occupied and we
were made prisoners.</p>

<p>This was an unexpected blow; yet it was one to which, on
second thoughts, I became reconciled. In the disturbed state
of the country, traveling was totally insecure, and even to
obtain a conveyance of any kind was a matter of extreme difficulty.
The roving plunderers who hovered in the train of the
camp were, of all plunderers, the most merciless; while, falling
into the hands of the legionaries, we were at least sure of
an escort; I might obtain some useful information of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
affairs, and once in sight of the city, might escape from the
Roman lines with more ease as a prisoner than I could pass
them as an enemy.</p>

<p>The cavalry moved at daybreak, and before night we saw
in the horizon the hills which surround Jerusalem. We had
full evidence of our approach to the center of struggle by the
devastation that follows the track of the best-disciplined
army—groves and orchards cut down, cornfields trampled,
cottages burned, gardens and homesteads ravaged. Farther
on, we traversed the encampments of the auxiliaries, barbarians
of every color and language within the limits of the
mightiest of empires.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Views
the Soldier of
Barbarism</div>

<p>To the soldier of civilized nations, war is a new state of existence;
to the soldier of barbarism, war is but a more active
species of his daily life. It requires no divorce from his old
habits, and even encourages his old objects, cares, and pleasures.
We found the Arab, the German, the Scythian, and
the Ethiop hunting, carousing, trafficking, and quarreling, as if
they had never stirred from their native regions. The hordes
brought with them their families, their cattle, and their trade.
In the rear of every auxiliary camp was a regular mart
crowded with all kinds of dealers. Through the fields the
barbarians were following the sports of home. Trains of
falconers were flying their birds at the wild pigeon and heron.
Half-naked horsemen were running races, without saddle
or rein, on horses as wild and swift as the antelope. Groups
were lying under the palm-groves asleep, with their spears
fixed at their heads; others were seen busily decorating themselves
for battle; crowds were dancing, gaming, and drinking.</p>

<p>As we advanced, we could hear the variety of clamors and
echoes that belong to barbarian war—the braying of savage
horns, the roars of mirth, rage, and feasting; the shouts of
clans moving up to reenforce the besiegers; the screams and
lamentations of the innumerable women, as the wains and litters
brought back the wounded; the barbarian howlings over
the hasty grave of some chieftain; the ferocious revelry of the
discoverers of plunder, and the inextinguishable sorrows of
the captives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>We passed through some miles of this boisterous and bustling
scene, in which even a Roman escort was scarcely a sufficient
security. The barbarians thronged round us, brandished
their spears over our heads, rode their horses full gallop
against us, and exhausted the whole language of scorn, ridicule,
and wrath upon our helpless condition.</p>

<p>But the clamor gradually died away, and we entered upon
another region,—a zone of silence and solitude interposed between
the dangerous riot of barbarism and the severe regularity
of the legions. Far within this circle, we reached the
Roman camp—the world of disciplined war! The setting
sun threw a flame on the long vistas of shield and helmet
drawn out, according to custom, for the hour of exercise before
nightfall. The tribunes were on horseback in front of
the cohorts, putting them through that boundless variety of
admirable movements in which no soldiery were so dexterous
as those of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Perfection
of Discipline</div>

<p>But all was done with characteristic silence. No sound
was heard but the measured tramp of the maneuver and the
voice of the tribune. The sight was at once absorbing to
the eye of one like me, an enthusiast in soldiership, and appalling
to the lover of his country. Before me was the great
machine, the resistless energy that had leveled the strength
of the most renowned kingdoms. With the feeling of a man
who sees the tempest at hand, in the immediate terror of the
bolt, I could yet gaze with wonder and admiration at the
grandeur of the thunder-cloud! Before me was at once the
perfection of power and the perfection of discipline. Here
were no rambling crowds of retainers, no hurrying of troops
startled by sudden rumor, no military clamors. All was calm,
regular, and grand. In the center of the most furious war
ever waged, I might have thought that I saw but a summer
camp in an Italian plain.</p>

<p>As the night fell, the legions saluted the parting sun with
homage, according to a custom which they had learned in
their eastern campaigns. Sounds less of war than of worship
arose; flutes breathed in low and sweet harmonies from
the lines; and this iron soldiery, bound on the business of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
extermination, moved to their tents in the midst of strains made
to wrap the heart in softness and solemnity.</p>

<p>I rose at dawn. But was I in a land of enchantment? I
looked for the immense camp—it had vanished. A few soldiers
collecting the prisoners sleeping about the field were all
that remained of an army. Our guard explained the wonder.
An attack on the trenches, in which the besiegers had been
driven in with serious loss, determined Titus to bring up his
whole force. The troops had moved with that habitual silence
which eluded almost the waking ear. They were now
beyond the hills, and the hour was come when the prisoners
were ordered to follow them. But where was the daughter
of Ananus? I had placed her in a tent with some captive
females of our nation. The tent was struck, and its inmates
were gone! On the spot where it stood a flock of sheep were
already grazing, with a Roman soldier leaning drowsily on his
spear for their shepherd.</p>

<p>To what alarms might not this fair girl be exposed? Dubious
and distressed, I followed the guard, in the hope of
discovering the fate of an innocent and lovely being, who
seemed, like myself, marked for misfortune.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Equipment of
Soldiers</div>

<p>In this march we traversed almost the whole circuit of the
hills surrounding Jerusalem, and I thus had, for three days,
the opportunity that I longed for, of seeing the nature of the
force with which we were to contend. The troops were admirably
armed. There was nothing for superfluity; yet
those who conceived the system knew the value of show,
and the equipment of the legions was superb. The helmets,
cuirasses, and swords were frequently inlaid with precious
metals, and the superior officers rode richly caparisoned
chargers, purchased at an enormous price from the finest studs
of Europe and Asia. The common soldier was proud of the
brightness of his shield and helmet; on duty both were covered,
but on their festivals the most cheering moment was
when the order was given to uncase their arms. Then nothing
could be more magnificent than the aspect of the legion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Methods of Warriors</div>

<p>One striking source of its pomp was the multitude of its
banners. Every emblem that mythology could feign, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
animal, every memorial connected with the history of soldiership
and Rome, glittered above the forest of spears. Gilded
serpents, wolves, lions, gods, genii, stars, diadems, imperial
busts, and the eagle paramount over all, were mingled with
vanes of purple and embroidery. The most showy pageant of
civil life was dull and colorless to the crowded splendor of the
Roman line.</p>

<p>Their system of maneuver gave this magnificence its full
development. With the modern armies the principle is the
avoidance of fire. With the ancient armies the principle was
the concentration of force. All was done by impulse. The
figure by which the greatest weight could be thrown against
the enemy’s ranks, was the secret of victory. The subtlety
of Italian imagination, enlightened by Greek science, and fertilized
by the experience of universal war, was occupied in the
discovery; and the field exercise of the legions displayed every
form into which troops could be shaped for victory. The Romans
always sought to fight pitched battles. They left the
minor services to their allies, and haughtily reserved themselves
for the master strokes by which empires are lost or
won. The humbler hostilities, the obscure skirmishings and
surprises, they disdained; observing that, while “to steal
upon men was the work of a thief, and to butcher them was
the habit of a barbarian, to fight them was the act of a soldier.”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Reign of the Sword</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Track of
Invasion</div>

<p>At the close of a weary day we reached our final station,
upon the hill of Scopas, seven furlongs from Jerusalem.
Bitter memory was busy with me there. From the spot on
which I flung myself in heaviness of heart, huddled among a
crowd of miserable captives, and wishing only that the evening
gathering over me might be my last, I had once looked
upon the army of the oppressors marching into my toils and
exulted in the secure glories of myself and my country.</p>

<p>But the prospect now beneath the eye showed only the
fiery track of invasion. The pastoral beauty of the plain was
utterly gone. The innumerable garden-houses and summer
dwellings of the Jewish nobles, gleaming in every variety of
graceful architecture, among vineyards and depths of aromatic
foliage, were leveled to the ground; and the gardens were
turned into a sandy waste, cut up by trenches and military
works in every direction. In the midst rose the great Roman
rampart, which Titus, in despair of conquering the city by the
sword, drew round it, to extinguish its last hope of provisions
or reenforcements—a hideous boundary, within which all was
to be the sepulcher.</p>

<p>I now saw Jerusalem only in her expiring struggle.<a name="ENanchor_43" id="ENanchor_43"></a><a href="#Endnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Others
have given the history of that most memorable siege. My
knowledge was limited to the last hideous days of an existence
long declining, and finally extinguished in horrors beyond
the imagination of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Fight in a Tempest</div>

<p>I knew her follies, her ingratitude, her crimes; but the love
of the city of David was deep in my soul; her lofty privileges,
the proud memory of those who had made her courts glorious,
the sage, the soldier, and the prophet, lights of the world, to
which the boasted illumination of the heathen was darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
filled my spirit with an immortal homage. I loved her then—I
love her still.</p>

<p>To mingle my blood with that of my perishing country was
the first wish of my heart. But I was under the rigor of the
confinement inflicted on the Jewish prisoners. My rank was
soon known; but while it produced offers of new distinction
from my captors, it increased their vigilance. To every temptation
I gave the same denial, and occupied my hours in
devices for escape. Meanwhile I saw with terror that the
wall of circumvallation was closing, and that a short period
must place an impassable barrier between me and the city.</p>

<p>I was aroused at midnight by the roaring of one of those
tempests which sometimes break in so fiercely upon an Eastern
summer. The lightning struck the tower in which I was
confined, and I found myself riding on a pile of ruins. Escape,
in the midst of a Roman camp, seemed as remote as
ever. But the storm which shook walls made its way at will
among tents, and the whole encampment was broken up. A
column of infantry passed where I was extricating myself
from the ruins. They were going to reenforce the troops in
the trenches, against the chance of an attack during the tempest.
I followed them. The night was terrible. The lightning
that blazed with frightful vividness, and then left the
sky to tenfold obscurity, alone led us through the lines. The
column was too late, and it found the besieged already mounted
upon the wall of circumvallation, and flinging it down in huge
fragments. The assault and defense were alike desperate.
At the moment of our arrival the night had grown pitchy
dark, and the only evidence that men were round me was the
clang of arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Rescues Constantius</div>

<p>A sudden flash showed me that we had reached the foot of
the rampart. The besieged, carried away by their native impetuosity,
poured down in crowds. Their leader, cheering
them on, was struck by a lance and fell. The sight rallied
the Romans. I felt that now or never was the moment for
my escape. I rushed in front, and called aloud my name.
At the voice the wounded leader uttered a cry which I well
knew. I caught him from the ground. A gigantic centurion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
darted forward and grasped my robe. Embarrassed with my
burden, I was on the point of being dragged back; the centurion’s
sword glittered over my head. With my only weapon,
a stone, I struck him a furious blow on the forehead. The
sword fell from his grasp; I seized it, and keeping the rest at
bay, and in the midst of shouts from my countrymen, leaped
the trench, with the nobler trophy in my arms—I had rescued
Constantius!</p>

<p>Jerusalem was now verging on the last horrors. I could
scarcely find my way through her ruins. The noble buildings
were destroyed by conflagration and the assaults of the various
factions. The monuments of our kings and tribes were
lying in mutilation at my feet. Every man of former eminence
was gone. Massacre and exile had been the masters of
the higher ranks; and even the accidental distinctions into
which the humbler were thrown by the few past years, involved
a fearful purchase of public hazard. Like men in an
earthquake, the elevation of each was only a sign to him of
the working of an irresistible principle of ruin. But the most
formidable characteristic was the change wrought in the popular
mind.</p>

<p>A single revolution may be a source of public good, but a
succession of great political changes is always fatal, alike to
public and private virtue. The sense of honor dies in the
fierce pressures of personal struggle. Humanity dies in the
sight of hourly violences. Conscience dies in the conflict
where personal safety is so often endangered that its preservation
at length usurps the mind. Religion dies where the
religious man is so often the victim of the unprincipled.
Violence and vice are soon found to be the natural instruments
of triumph in a war of the passions; and the more relentless
atrocity carries the day, until selfishness—the mother
of treachery, rapine, and carnage—is the paramount principle.
Then the nation perishes, or is sent forth in madness and misery,
an object of terror and infection, to propagate evil through
the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wrecks of Pillage</div>

<p>The very features of the popular physiognomy were changed.
The natural vividness of the countenance was there, but hardened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
by habitual ferocity. I was surrounded by a multitude,
in each of whom I was compelled to see the assassin. The
keen eye scowled with cruelty; the cheek wore the alternate
flush and paleness of desperate thoughts. The hurried gatherings,
the quick quarrel, the loud blasphemy, told me the infuriate
temper that had fallen, for the last curse, on Jerusalem.
Scarcely a man passed me of whom I could not have
said: “There goes one from a murder or to a murder.”</p>

<p>But even more open evidences startled me, accustomed as I
was to scenes of military violence. I saw men stabbed in
familiar greetings in the streets; mansions set on fire and
burned in the face of day, with their inmates screaming for
help, and yet unhelped; hundreds slain in rabble tumults, of
which no one knew the origin. The streets were covered with
the wrecks of pillage, sumptuous furniture plundered from the
mansions of the great, and plundered for the mere love of
ruin; mingled with the more hideous wrecks of man—unburied
bodies, left to whiten in the blast or to be torn by the
dogs.</p>

<p>Three factions divided Jerusalem, even while the Roman
battering-rams were shaking her colossal towers; three armies
fought night and day within the city. Streets undermined,
houses battered down, granaries burned, wells poisoned, the
perpetual shower of death upon each other from the roofs,
made the external hostility trivial; and the Romans required
only patience to have been bloodless masters of a city which
yet they would have found only a tomb of its people.</p>

<p>I wandered day by day, an utter stranger, through Jerusalem.
All the familiar faces were gone. At an early period
of the war, many of the higher ranks, foreseeing the event,
had left the city; at a later, my victory over Cestius, by
driving back the enemy, had given a free passage to a crowd
of others. It was at that time remarked that the crowd were
chiefly Christians, and a singular prophecy of their Master was
declared to be the warning of their escape. It is certain that
of His followers, including many even of our priests and
learned men, scarcely one remained.<a name="ENanchor_44" id="ENanchor_44"></a><a href="#Endnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> They said that the evil
day, menaced by the divine Wisdom, through Moses (may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
he rest in glory!) was come; that the death of their Master
was the consummate crime; and that the Romans, the predicted
nation of destroyers, the people “of a strange speech,”
flying on “eagle wings from the ends of the earth,” were already
commissioned against a land stained with the blood of
the Messiah.</p>

<p>Fatally was the word of the great prophet of Israel accomplished;
fearfully fell the sword, to smite away root and
branch; solemnly, and by a hand which scorned the strength
of man, was the deluge of ruin let loose against the throne of
David. And still through almost two thousand years, the
flood of desolation is at the full; no mountain-top is seen rising
above; no spot is left clear for the sole of the Jewish
foot; no dove returns with the olive.</p>

<p>Eternal King, shall this be forever? Wilt Thou utterly reject
the children of him whom thy right hand brought from
the land of the idolater? Wilt Thou forever hide Thy glory
from the tribes whom it led through the burning wilderness?
Wilt Thou never raise the broken kingdom of Thy servant
Israel? Still we wander in darkness, the tenants of a prison,
whose chains we feel at every step; the scoff of the idolater,
the captive of the infidel. Have we not abided without king
or priest, or ephod or teraphim, “many days”—when are
those days to be at an end?</p>

<p>Yet is not the captivity at last about to close? Is not the
trumpet at the lip to summon Thy chosen? Are not the
broken tribes now awaiting but Thy command to come from
the desert, from the dungeon, from the mine, like the light
from darkness? I gaze upon the stars and think, countless
and glorious as they are, such shall yet be thy multitude and
thy splendor, people of the undone! The promise of the
King of Kings is fulfilling, and even now, to my withered
eyes, to my struggling prayer, to the deeper agonies of a supplication
that no tongue can utter, there is a vision and an
answer. On the flint, worn by kneeling, I hear the midnight
voice; and weeping, wait for the day that will come,
tho heaven and earth shall pass away.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>A Cry of Wo</i></span></h3>

<p>My first object was to ascertain the fate of my family.
From Constantius I could learn nothing, for the severity of
his wound had reduced him to such a state that he recognized
no one. I sat by him day after day, watching with bitter
solicitude for the return of his senses. He raved continually
of his wife, and of every other name that I loved. The affecting
eloquence of his appeals sometimes plunged me into
the deepest depression—sometimes drove me out to seek relief
from them, even in the horrors of the streets. I was the most
solitary of men. In those melancholy wanderings, none spoke
to me; I spoke to none. The kinsmen whom I had left under
the command of my brave son were slain or dispersed, and on
the night when I saw him warring with his native ardor, the
men whom he led to the foot of the rampart were an accidental
band, excited by his brilliant intrepidity to choose him
at the instant for their captain. In sorrow, indeed, had I
entered Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Devastation of
Jerusalem</div>

<p>The devastation of the city was enormous during its tumults.
The great factions were reduced to two, but in the
struggle a large portion of the Temple had been burned.
The stately chambers of the priests were dust and embers.
The cloisters which surrounded the sanctuary were beaten
down or left naked to the visitation of the seasons, which
now, as by the peculiar wrath of heaven, had assumed a fierce
and ominous inclemency. Tremendous bursts of tempest constantly
shook the city, and the popular mind was kept in perpetual
alarm at the accidents which followed those storms.
Fires were frequently caused by the lightning; deluges of rain
flooded the streets, and falling on the shattered roofs, increased
the misery of their famishing inhabitants; the sudden severity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of winter in the midst of spring added to the sufferings of a
people doubly unprovided to encounter it, by its unexpectedness
and by their necessary exposure on the battlements and
in the field.</p>

<p>Within the walls all bore the look of a grave, and even that
grave shaken by some great convulsion of nature. From the
battlements the sight was absolute despair. The Roman
camps covered the hills, and we could see the soldiery sharpening
the very lances that were to drink our blood. The fires
of their night-watches lighted up the horizon round. We
hourly heard the sound of their trumpets and their shouts,
as the sheep in the fold might hear the roaring of the lion
and the tiger, ready to leap their feeble boundary. Yet the
valor of the people was never wearied out. The vast mound,
whose circle was to shut us up from the help of man or the
hope of escape, was the grand object of attack and defense;
and tho thousands of my countrymen covered the ground
at its foot with their corpses, the Jew was still ready to
rush on the Roman spear. This valor was spontaneous, for
subordination had long been at an end. The names of John
of Giscala, and Simon, influential as they were in the earlier
periods of the war, had lost their force in the civil fury and
desperate pressures of the siege. No leaders were acknowledged
but hatred of the enemy, iron fortitude, and a determination
not to survive the fall of Jerusalem!</p>

<p>In this furious warfare I took my share with the rest;
handled the spear, and fought and watched without thinking
of any distinction of rank. My military experience, and the
personal strength which enabled me to render prominent services
in those desultory attacks, often excited our warriors to
offer me the command; but ambition was dead within me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Universal
Outcry</div>

<p>I was one day sitting beside the bed of Constantius, and
bitterly absorbed in gazing on what I thought the progress of
death, when I heard a universal outcry, more melancholy than
human voices seemed ever made to utter. My first thought
was that the enemy had forced the gates. I took my sword
down and prepared to go out and die. I found the streets
filled with crowds hurrying forward without any apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
direction, but all exhibiting a sorrow amounting to agony;
wringing their hands, beating their bosoms, tearing their hair,
and casting dust and ashes on their heads. A large body of
the priesthood came rushing from the temple with loud
lamentations. The <span class="smcap">Daily Sacrifice</span> had ceased!<a name="ENanchor_45" id="ENanchor_45"></a><a href="#Endnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The perpetual
offering, which, twice a day, burned in testimonial of
the sins and the expiation of Israel, the peculiar homage of
the nation to Heaven, was no more! The siege had extinguished
the resources of the Temple; the victims could no
longer be supplied, and the people must perish without the
power of atonement! This was the final cutting off—the declaration
of the sentence—the seal of the great condemnation.
Jerusalem was undone!</p>

<p>Overpowered by this fatal sign, I was sadly returning to
my worse than solitary chamber, for there lay, speechless and
powerless, the noblest creature that breathed in Jerusalem—when
I was driven aside by a new torrent of the people, exclaiming
“The prophet! the prophet! wo to the city of
David!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wo, Wo, Wo</div>

<p>They rushed on in haggard multitudes, and in the midst of
them came a maniac bounding and gesticulating with indescribable
wildness. His constant exclamation was “Wo!—wo!—wo!”
uttered in a tone that searched the very
heart. He stopped from time to time, flung out some denunciation
against the popular crimes, and then recommenced his
cry of “Wo!” and bounded forward again.</p>

<p>He at length came opposite to the spot where I stood, and
his features struck me as resembling those I had seen before.
But they were full of a strange impulse—the grandeur of inspiration
mingled with the animal fierceness of frenzy. The
eye shot fire under the sharp and hollow brows; the nostrils
contracted and opened like those of an angry steed, and every
muscle of a singularly elastic frame was quivering and exposed
from the effects alike of mental violence and famine.</p>

<p>“Ho, Prince of Naphtali! we meet at last!” was his instant
outcry. His countenance fell, and tears gushed from
lids that looked incapable of a human feeling. “I found
her,” said he, “my beauty, my bride! She was in the dungeon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
The ring that I tore from that villain’s finger was
worth a gold-mine, for it opened the gates of her prison.
Come forth, girl!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sabat the Ishmaelite</div>

<p>With these words he caught by the hand and led to me a
pale creature, with the traces of loveliness, but evidently in
the last stage of mortal decay. She stood silent as a statue.
In compassion, I took her hand, while the multitude gathered
round us in curiosity. I now remembered Sabat, the Ishmaelite,
and his story.</p>

<p>“She is mad,” said Sabat, shaking his head mournfully,
and gazing on the fading form at his side. “Worlds would
not restore her senses. But there is a time for all things.”
He sighed, and cast his large eyes on heaven. “I watched
her day and night,” he went on, “until I grew mad too. But
the world will have an end, and then—all will be well.
Come, wife, we must be going. To-night there are strange
things within the walls, and without the walls. There will
be feasting and mourning; there will be blood and tears; then
comes the famine—then comes the fire—then the sword; and
then all is quiet, and forever!”</p>

<p>He paused, wiped away the tears, then began again wilder
than ever: “Heaven is mighty! To-night there will be wonders;
watch well your walls, people of the ruined city! To-night
there will be signs; let no man sleep but those who
sleep in the grave. Prince of Naphtali, have you too sworn,
as I have, to die?” He lifted his meager hand. “Come,
thunders! come, fires! vengeance cries from the sanctuary.
Listen, undone people! listen, nation of sorrow! the ministers
of wrath are on the wing. Wo!—wo!—wo!”</p>

<p>In pronouncing those words with a voice of the most sonorous
yet melancholy power, he threw himself into a succession
of strange and fearful gestures; then beckoning to the female,
who submissively followed his steps, plunged away among the
multitude. I heard the howl of “Wo!—wo!—wo!” long
echoed through the windings of the ruined streets, and
thought that I heard the voice of the angel of desolation.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Struggle for Supremacy</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Sickness
of the Heart</div>

<p>The seventeenth day of the month Tamuz, ever memorable
in the sufferings of Israel, was the last of the Daily Sacrifice.
Sorrow and fear were on the city, and the silence of the night
was broken by the lamentations of the multitude. I returned
to my chamber of affliction, and busied myself in preparing
for the guard of the Temple, to withdraw my mind from the
gloom that was beginning to master me. Yet when I looked
round the room, and thought of what I had been, of the opulent
enjoyments of my palace, and of the beloved faces which
surrounded me there, I felt the sickness of the heart.</p>

<p>The chilling air that blew through the dilapidated walls,
the cruse of water, the scanty bread, the glimmering lamp,
the comfortless and squalid bed, on which lay in the last
stages of weakness a patriot and a hero—a being full of fine
affections and abilities, reduced to the helplessness of an infant,
and whom in leaving for the night I might be leaving
to perish by the poniard of the robber—unmanned me. I
cast the simitar from my hand, and sat down with a sullen
determination there to linger until death, or that darker vengeance
which haunted me, should do its will.</p>

<p>The night was stormy, and the wind howled in long and
bitter gusts through the deserted chambers of the huge mansion.
But the mind is the true place of suffering, and I felt
the season’s visitation in my locks drenched about my face,
and my tattered robes swept by the freezing blasts, as only
the natural course of things.</p>

<p>I was sitting by the bedside, moistening the fevered lips of
Constantius with water, and pressing on him the last fragment
of bread which I might ever have to give, when I, with
sudden delight, heard him utter for the first time articulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
sounds. I stooped to catch accents so dear and full of hope.
But the words were a supplication—he prayed to the Christian’s
God!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prayer of
Constantius</div>

<p>I turned away from this resistless conviction of his belief.
But this was no time for debate, and I was won to listen
again. His voice was scarcely above a whisper, but his language
was the aspiration of the heart. His eyes were closed,
and, evidently unconscious of my presence, in his high communion
with Heaven, he talked of things of which I had but
imperfect knowledge or none; of blood shed for the sins of
man; of a descended Spirit to guide the servants of Heaven;
of the unspeakable love that gave the Son of God to mortal
suffering for the atonement of that human guilt which nothing
but such a sacrifice could atone. He finished by the names
dear to us both; and praying “for their safety if they still
were in life, or for their meeting beyond the grave, declared
himself resigned to the will of his Lord.”</p>

<p>I waited in sacred awe until I saw, by the subsiding motion
of the lips, that the prayer was done, and then, anxious to
gain information of my family, questioned him. But with
the prayer the interval of mental power had passed away.
The veil was drawn over his senses once more, and his answers
were unintelligible. Yet even the hope of his restoration
lightened my gloom; my spirits, naturally elastic, shook off
their leaden weight; I took up the simitar, and pressing the
cold hand of my noble fellow victim, prepared to issue forth
to the Temple. The storm was partially gone, and the moon,
approaching to the full, was high in heaven, fighting her way
through masses of rapid cloud. The wind still roared in long
blasts, as the tempest retired, like an army repulsed, and indignant
at being driven from the spoil. But the ground was
deluged, and a bitter sleet shot on our half-naked bodies. I
had far to pass through the streets of the upper city, and
their aspect was deeply suited to the melancholy of the hour.</p>

<p>Vast walls and buttresses of the burned and overthrown
mansions remained, that in the spectral light looked like
gigantic specters. Ranges of inferior ruins stretched to the
utmost glance; some yet sending up the smoke of recent conflagration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and others beaten down by the storms or left to
decay. The immense buildings of the hierarchy, once the
scene of all but kingly magnificence, stood roofless and windowless,
with the light sadly gleaming through their fissures,
and the wind singing a dirge of ruin through their halls. I
scarcely met a human being, for the sword and famine had
fearfully reduced the once countless population.</p>

<p>But I often startled a flight of vultures from their meal; or,
in the sinking of the light, stumbled upon a heap that uttered
a cry, and showed that life was there; or from his horrid morsel,
a wretch glared upon me, as one wolf might glare upon
another, that came to rob him of his prey; or the twinkling
of a miserable lamp in the corner of a ruin glimmered over a
knot of felony and murder, reckoning their hideous gains and
carousing with the dagger drawn. Heaps of bones, whitening
in the air, were the monuments of the wasted valor of my
countrymen, and the oppressive atmosphere gave the sensation
of walking in a sepulcher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Avenues
of Death</div>

<p>I dragged my limbs with increased difficulty through those
long avenues of death that, black, silent, and split into a
thousand shapes of ruin, looked less like the streets of a city
than the rocky defiles of a mountain shattered by lightnings
and earthquakes. On the summit of the hill I found a crowd
of unhappy beings, who came, like myself, actuated by zeal to
defend the Temple from the insults to which its sanctity was
now nightly exposed. Faction had long extinguished the native
homage of the people. Battles had been fought within
its walls, and many a corpse loaded the sacred floors, that
once would have required solemn ceremonies to free them
from the pollution of an unlicensed step.</p>

<p>And what a band was assembled there! Wretches mutilated
by wounds, worn with sleeplessness, haggard with want
of food; shivering together on the declivity, whose naked
elevation exposed them to the whole inclemency of the night;
flung like the dead, on the ground, or gathered in little knots
among the ruined porticos, with death in every frame and
despair in every heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Views the Pomp of War</div>

<p>I was sheltering myself behind the broken columns of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Grand gate, from the bitter wind which searched every fiber,
and was sinking into that chilling torpor which benumbs body
and mind alike, when a clash of military music and the tramp
of a multitude assailed my ear. I started up and found my
miserable companions mustered, from the various hollows of
the hill, to our post on the central ground of Mount Moriah,
whence the view was boundless on every side. A growing
blaze rose up from the valley and flashed upon the wall of
circumvallation. The sounds of cymbal and trumpet swelled;
the light advanced rapidly; and going the circuit of the wall,
helmets and lances of the cavalry were seen glittering through
the gloom; a crowd of archers preceded a dense body of the
legionary horse, at whose head rode a group of officers. On
this night the fatal wall had been completed, and Titus was
going its round in triumph. Every horseman carried a torch,
and strong divisions of infantry followed, bearing lamps and
vessels of combustible matter on the points of their spears.
As the whole moved, rolling and bending with the inequalities
of the ground, I thought that I saw a mighty serpent,
coiling his burning spires round the prey that was never to be
rescued by the power of man.</p>

<p>But the pomp of war below and the wretchedness round
me, raised reflections of such bitterness that when Titus and
his splendid troop reached the mountain of the Temple, one
outcry of sorrow and anticipated ruin burst from us all. The
conqueror heard it, and, from the instant maneuvering of his
troops, was evidently alarmed; he had known the courage of
the Jews too long not to dread the effect of their despair.
And despair it was, fierce and untamable!</p>

<p>I started forward, exclaiming: “If there is a man among
you ready to stake his life for his country, let him follow
me.”</p>

<p>To the last hour the Jew was a warrior! The crowd seized
their spears, and we sprang down the cliffs. As we reached
the outer wall of the city, I restrained their exhaustless spirit
until I had singly ascertained the state of the enemy. Titus
was passing the well-known ravine near the fountain-gate,
where the ground was difficult for cavalry, from its being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
chiefly divided into gardens. I flung open the gate, and led
the way to the circumvallation. The sentinels, occupied
with looking on the pomp, suffered us to approach unperceived;
we mounted the wall, overthrew everything before us,
and plunged down upon the cavalry, entangled in the ravine.
It was a complete surprise.</p>

<p>The bravery of the legions was not proof against the fury
of our attack. Even our wild faces and half-naked forms, by
the uncertain glare of the torches, looked scarcely human.
Horse and man rolled down the declivity. The arrival of
fresh troops only increased the confusion; their torches made
them a mark for our pikes and arrows; every point told, and
every Roman that fell, armed a Jew. The conflict now became
murderous, and we stabbed at our ease the troopers of
the Emperor’s guard, through their mail, while their long
lances were useless.</p>

<p>The defile gave us incalculable advantages, for the garden
walls were impassable by the cavalry, while we bounded over
them like deer. All was uproar, terror, and rage. We actually
waded through blood. At every step, I trod on horse or
man; helmets and bucklers, lances and armor, lay in heaps,
and the stream of the ravine soon ran purple with the proudest
gore of the legions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman
Charge</div>

<p>At length, while we were absolutely oppressed with the
multitude of dead, a sudden blast of trumpets and the shouts
of the enemy led me to prepare for a still fiercer effort. A
tide of cavalry poured over the ground; Titus, a gallant figure,
cheering them on, with his helmet in his hand, galloped
in their front; I withdrew my wearied followers from the exposed
situation into which their success had led them, and
posting them behind a rampart of Roman dead, awaited the
charge. It came with the force of thunder; the powerful
horses of the imperial squadron broke over our rampart at the
first shock and bore us down like stubble. Every man of us
was under their feet in a moment; and yet the very number
of our assailants saved us. The narrowness of the place gave
no room for the management of the horse; the darkness assisted
both our escape and assault; and even lying on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
ground, we plunged our knives in horse and rider, with terrible
retaliation.</p>

<p>The cavalry at length gave way, but the Roman general, a
man of the heroic spirit that is only inflamed by repulse,
rushed forward among the disheartened troops, and roused
them by his cries and gestures to retrieve their honor. After
a few bold words, he again charged at their head. I singled
him out, as I saw his golden helmet gleam in the torch-light.
To capture the son of Vespasian would have been a triumph
worth a thousand lives. Titus<a name="ENanchor_46" id="ENanchor_46"></a><a href="#Endnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> was celebrated for personal
dexterity in the management of the horse and lance, and I
could not withhold my admiration of the skill with which he
penetrated the difficulties of the field, and the mastery with
which he overthrew all that opposed him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Attacks Titus</div>

<p>Our motley ranks were already scattering, when I cried out
my name and defied him to the combat. He stooped over his
charger’s neck to discover his adversary, and seeing before
him a being as blackened and beggared as the most dismantled
figure of the crowd, gave a laugh of fierce derision, and was
turning away, when our roar of scorn recalled him. He
struck in the spur, and couching his lance, bounded toward
me. To have waited his attack must have been destruction;
I sprang aside, and with my full vigor flung my javelin; it
went through his buckler. He reeled, and a groan rose from
the legionaries who were rushing forward to his support. He
stopped them with a fierce gesture, and casting off the entangled
buckler, charged again. But the hope of the imperial
diadem was not to be thus cheaply hazarded. The whole circle
of cavalry rolled in upon us; I was dragged down by a hundred
hands, and Titus was forced away, indignant at the zeal
which had thwarted his fiery valor.</p>

<p>In the confusion I was forgotten, burst through the concourse,
and rejoined my countrymen, who had given me over
for lost, and now received me with shouts of victory. The
universal cry was to advance, but I felt that the limit of triumph
for that night was come; the engagement had become
known to the whole range of the enemy’s camps, and troops
without number were already pouring down. I ordered a retreat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
but there was one remaining exploit to make the night’s
service memorable.</p>

<p>Leaving a few hundred pikemen outside the circumvallation,
to keep off any sudden attempt, I set every hand at work to
gather the dry weeds, rushes, and fragments of trees from
the low grounds into a pile. It was laid against the rampart.
I flung the first torch, and pile and rampart were soon alike
in a blaze. Volumes of flame, carried by the wind, rolled
round its entire circuit. The Romans rushed down in multitudes
to extinguish the fire. But this became continually
more difficult. Jerusalem had been roused from its sleep,
and the extravagant rumors that a great victory was obtained,
Titus slain, and the enemy’s camp taken by storm, stimulated
the natural spirit of the people to the most boundless confidence.
Every Jew who could find a lance, an arrow, or a
knife hurried to the gates, and the space between the walls
and the circumvallation was crowded with an army which, in
that crisis of superhuman exultation, perhaps no disciplined
force on earth could have outfought.</p>

<p>Nothing could now save the rampart. Torches innumerable,
piles of faggots, arms, even the dead, all things that
could burn, were flung upon it. Thousands, who at other
times might have shrunk, forgot the name of fear, leaped
into the very midst of the flames, and tearing up the blazing
timbers, dug to the heart of the rampart and filled
the hollows with sulfur and bitumen; thousands struggled
across the tumbling ruins, to throw themselves among the
Roman spearsmen and see the blood of an enemy before
they died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rampart’s
Illumination</div>

<p>War never had a bolder moment. Human nature, roused
to the wildest height of enthusiasm, was lavishing life like
dust. The ramparts spread a horrid light upon the havoc;
every spot of the battle, every group of the furious living, and
the trampled and deformed dead, was keenly visible. The
ear was deafened by the incessant roar of flame, the falling
of the huge heaps of the rampart, and the agonies and exultations
of men, reveling in mutual slaughter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Phenomenon in the Sky</div>

<p>In that hour came one of those solemn signs that marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the downfall of Jerusalem. The tempest, that had blown at
intervals with tremendous violence, died away at once; and a
surge of light ascended from the horizon and rolled up rapidly
to the zenith. The phenomenon instantly fixed every eye.
There was an indefinable sense in the general mind that a sign
of power and providence was about to be given. The battle
ceased; the outcries were followed by utter silence; the armed
ranks stood still, in the very act of rushing on each other; all
faces were turned on the heavens.</p>

<p>The light rose pale and quivering like the meteors of a summer
evening. But in the zenith, it spread and swelled into a
splendor that distinguished it irresistibly from the wonders of
earth or air. It swiftly eclipsed every star. The moon vanished
before it; the canopy of the sky seemed to be dissolved,
for a view into a bright and infinite region beyond, fit for the
career of those mighty beings to whom man is but the dust on
the gale.</p>

<p>As we gazed, this boundless field was transformed into a
field of battle; multitudes seemed to crowd it in the fiercest
combat; horsemen charged and died under their horses’ feet;
armor and standards were trampled in blood; column and line
burst through each other. At length the battle stooped toward
the earth, and with hearts beating with indescribable
feelings we recognized in the fight the banners of the tribes.
It was Jew and Roman struggling for life; the very countenances
of the combatants became visible, and each man below
saw a representative of himself above. The fate of Jewish
war was there written by the hand of Heaven; the fate of
the individual was there predicted in the individual triumph
or fall. What tongue of man can tell the intense interest
with which we watched every blow, every movement, every
wound, of those images of ourselves?</p>

<p>The light now illumined the whole horizon below. The
legions were seen drawn out in front of the camps, ready for
action—every helmet and spear-point glittering in the radiance;
every face turned up, gazing in awe and terror on the
sky. The tents spreading over the hills; the thousands and
tens of thousands of auxiliaries and captives; the little groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of the peasantry, roused from sleep by the uproar of the
night, and gathered upon the knolls and eminences of their
fields—all were bathed in a flood of preternatural luster.
But the wondrous battle approached its close. The visionary
Romans seemed to shake, column and cohort gave way,
and the banners of the tribes waved in victory over the
celestial field. Then human voices dared to be heard. From
the city and the plain burst forth one mighty shout of
triumph!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Dreadful
Sign</div>

<p>But our presumption was soon to be checked. A peal of
thunder that made the very ground tremble under our feet
rolled from the four quarters of the heaven. The conquering
host shook, broke, and fled in utter confusion over the sapphire
field. It was pursued, but by no semblance of the
Roman.</p>

<p>An awful enemy was on its steps. Flashes of forked fire,
like myriads of lances, darted after it; cloud on cloud deepened
down, as the smoke of a mighty furnace; globes of light
shot blasting and burning along its track. Then amid the
double roar of thunder rushed forth the chivalry of heaven.
Shapes of transcendent beauty, yet with looks of wrath that
withered the human eye—armed sons of immortality descending
on the wing by millions—mingled with shapes and instruments
of ruin, for which the mind has no conception. The
circle of the heaven was filled with the chariots and horses of
fire. Flight was in vain; the weapons were seen to drop from
the Jewish host; their warriors sank upon the splendid field.
Still the immortal armies poured on, trampling and blasting,
until the last of the routed were consumed.</p>

<p>The angry pomp then paused. Countless wings were
spread, and the angelic multitudes, having done the work of
vengeance, rushed upward, with the sound of ocean in the
storm. The roar of trumpets and thunders was heard, until
the splendor was lost in the heights of the empyrean.</p>

<p>We felt the terrible warning. Our strength was dried up
at the sight; despair seized upon our souls. We had seen the
fate of Jerusalem. No victory over man could now save us
from the coming of final ruin!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Despair</div>

<p>Thousands never left the ground on which they stood; they
perished by their own hands, or lay down and died of broken
hearts. The rest fled through the night, that again wrapped
them in tenfold darkness. The whole multitude scattered
with soundless steps, and in silence like an army of specters.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Sting of a Story</i></span></h3>

<p>In the deepest dejection that could overwhelm the human
mind, I returned to the city, where one melancholy care still
bound me to existence. I hastened to my comfortless shelter,
but the battle had fluctuated so far around the walls that I
found myself perplexed, among the ruins of a portion of the
lower city, a crowd of obscure streets which belonged almost
wholly to strangers and the poorer population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In
the Darkness
of Night</div>

<p>The faction of John of Giscala, composed chiefly of the
more profligate and beggared class, had made the lower city
their stronghold, before they became masters of Mount Moriah;
and some desperate skirmishes, of which conflagrations were
the perpetual consequence, laid waste the principal part of a
district built and ruined by the haste and carelessness of
poverty. To find a guide through this scene of dilapidation
was hopeless, for every living creature, terrified by the awful
portents of the sky, had fled from the streets. The night
was solid darkness. No expiring gleam from the burned rampart,
no fires of the Roman camps, no torch on the Jewish
battlements, broke the pitchy blackness. Life and light
seemed to have perished together.</p>

<p>To proceed soon became impossible, and I had no other
resource than to wait the coming of day. But to one accustomed
as I was to hardships, this inconvenience was trivial.
I felt my way along the walls, to the entrance of a house that
promised some protection from the night, and flinging myself
into a corner, vainly tried to slumber. But the rising of the
storm and the rain pouring upon my lair drove me to seek a
more sheltered spot within the ruin. The destruction was
so effectual that this was difficult to discover, and I was hopelessly
returning to take my chance in the open air when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
observed the glimmer of a lamp through a crevice in the upper
part of the building. My first impulse was to approach and
obtain assistance. But the abruptness of the ascent gave me
time to consider the hazard of breaking in upon such groups
as might be gathered at that hour, in a period when every
atrocity under heaven reigned in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>My patience was put to but brief trial, for in a few minutes
I heard a low hymn. It paused, as if followed by
prayer. The hymn began again, in accents so faint as evidently
to express the fear of the worshipers. But the
sounds thrilled through my soul. I listened, in a struggle of
doubt and hope. Could I be deceived? and if I were, how
bitter must be the discovery. I sat down at the foot of the
rude stair, to feed myself with the fancied delight before it
should be snatched from me forever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sudden
Reunion</div>

<p>But my perturbation would have risen to madness had I
stopped longer. I climbed up the tottering steps; half-way I
found myself obstructed by a door; I struck upon it, and
called aloud. After an interval of miserable delay, a still
higher door was opened, and a figure enveloped in a veil
timidly looked out and asked my purpose. I saw, glancing
over her, two faces that I would have given the world to see.
I called out “Miriam!” Overpowered with emotion, my
speech failed me. I lived only in my eyes. I saw Miriam
fling off the mantle with a scream of joy, and rush down the
steps. I saw my two daughters follow her with the speed of
love; the door was thrown open, and I fell fainting into their
arms.</p>

<p>Tears, exclamations, and gazings were long our only language.
My wife hung over my wasted frame with endless
embraces and sobs of joy. My daughters fell at my feet,
bathed my cold hands with their tears, smiled on me in
speechless delight, and then wept again. They had thought
me lost to them forever. I had thought them dead, or
driven to some solitude which forbade us to meet again on
this side of the grave. For two years, two dreadful years,
a lonely man on earth, a wifeless husband, a childless father,
tried by every misery of mind and body; here—here I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
found my treasure once more! On this spot, wretched and
destitute as it was, in the midst of public misery and
personal wo, I had found those whose loss would have
made the riches of mankind, beggary to me. My soul overflowed.
Words were not made to tell the feverish fondness,
the strong delight that quivered through me. I wept
with woman’s weakness; I held my wife and children at
arm’s length, that I might enjoy the full happiness of gazing
on them; then my eyes grew dim, and I caught them to my
heart, and in silence, the silence of unspeakable emotion,
tried to collect my thoughts and to convince myself that my
joy was no dream.</p>

<p>The night passed in mutual inquiries. The career of my
family had been deeply diversified. On my capture in the
great battle with Cestius, in which it was said that I had
fallen, they were on the point of coming to Jerusalem to ascertain
their misfortune. The advance of the Romans to
Masada precluded this. They sailed for Alexandria, and
were overtaken by a storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Terror
of a Memory</div>

<p>“In that storm,” said Miriam, with terror painted on her
countenance, “we saw a sight that appalled the firmest heart
among us, and which to this hour recalls fearful images.
The night had fallen intensely dark. Our vessel, laboring
through the tempest during the day and greatly shattered,
was expected to go down before morn, and I had come upon
the deck, prepared to submit to the general fate, when I saw
a flame in the distance, and pointed it out to the mariners;
but they were paralyzed by weariness and fear, and instead
of approaching what I conceived to be a beacon, they left the
vessel to the mercy of the wind. I watched the light; to my
astonishment, I saw it advancing over the waves. It was a
large ship on fire, and rushing down upon us. Then, indeed,
there was no insensibility among our mariners; they were like
madmen, through excess of fear—they did everything but
make an effort to escape the danger.</p>

<p>“The blazing ship came toward us with terrific rapidity.
As it approached, the figure of a man was seen on the deck,
standing unhurt, in the midst of the burning. The Syrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
pilot, hitherto the boldest of our crew, at this sight cast the
helm from his hands in despair, and tore his beard, exclaiming
that we were undone. To our questions, he would give
no other answer than by pointing to the solitary being who
stood calmly in the center of the conflagration, more like a demon
than a man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Solitary Figure
Accursed</div>

<p>“I proposed that we should make some effort to rescue this
unfortunate man. But the pilot, horror-struck at the thought,
then gave up the tale that it cost him agonies even to utter.
He told us that the being whom our frantic compassion would
attempt to save, was an accursed thing; that for some crime,
too inexpiable to allow of his remaining among creatures capable
of hope, he was cast out from men, stricken into the nature
of the condemned spirits, and sentenced to rove the ocean
in fire, ever burning and never consumed!”</p>

<p>I felt every word, as if that fire was devouring my flesh.
The sense of what I was, and what I must be, was poison.
My head swam; mortal pain overwhelmed me. And this
abhorred thing I was; this sentenced and fearful wretch I
was, covered with wrath and shame; this exile from human
nature I was; and I heard my sentence pronounced and my
existence declared hideous by the lips on which I hung for
confidence and consolation against the world.</p>

<p>Flinging my robe over my face to hide its writhings, I
seemed to listen, but my ears refused to hear. In my perturbation,
I once thought of boldly avowing the truth, and
thus freeing myself from the pang of perpetual concealment.
But the offense and the retribution were too real and too
deadly to be disclosed, without destroying the last chance of
happiness to those innocent sufferers. I mastered the convulsion,
and again bent my ear.</p>

<p>“Our story exhausts you,” said Miriam; “but it is done.
After a long pursuit, in which the burning ship followed us
as if with the express purpose of our ruin, we were snatched
from a death by fire, only to undergo the chance of one by the
waves, for we were sinking. Yet it may have been owing
even to that chase that we were saved. The ship had driven
us toward land. At sea we must have perished, but the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
was found to be so near, that the country people, guided by
the flame, saved us, without the loss of a life. Once on
shore, we met with some of the fugitives from Masada, who
brought us to Jerusalem, the only remaining refuge for our
unhappy nation.”</p>

<p>To prevent a recurrence of this torturing subject, I mastered
my emotion so far as to ask some question of the siege.
But Miriam’s thoughts were still busy with the sea. After
some hesitation, and as if she dreaded the answer, she said:</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cry of
Recognition</div>

<p>“One extraordinary circumstance made me take a strong
interest in the fate of that solitary being on board the burning
vessel. It once seemed to have the most striking likeness
to you. I even cried out to it under that impression, but
fortunate it was for us all that my heedless cry was not answered,
for when it approached us I could see its countenance
change; it threw a sheet of flame across our vessel that
almost scorched us; and then perhaps thinking that our destruction
was complete, the human fiend ascended from the
waters in a pillar of intense fire.”</p>

<p>I felt deep pain at this romantic narrative. My mysterious
sentence was the common talk of mankind. My frightful
secret, that I had thought locked up in my own heart, was
loose as the air. This was enough to make life bitter. But
to be identified in the minds of my family with the object of
universal horror, was a chance which I determined not to
contemplate. My secret there was still safe; and my resolution
became fixed, never to destroy that safety by any frantic
confidence of my own.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Salathiel’s Strange Quarters</i></span></h3>

<p>While, with my head bent on my knees, I hung in the
misery of self-abhorrence, I heard the name of Constantius
sorrowfully pronounced beside me. The state in which he
must be left by my long absence flashed upon my mind; I
raised my eyes, and saw Salome. It was her voice that
sounded, and I then first observed the work of wo in her
form and features. She was almost a shadow; her eye was
lusterless, and the hands that she clasped in silent prayer
were reduced to the bone. But before I could speak, Miriam
made a sign of silence to me, and led the mourner away;
then returning, said:</p>

<p>“I dreaded lest you might make any inquiries before Salome,
for her husband. Religion alone has kept her from the grave.
On our arrival here, we found our noble Constantius worn out
by the fatigue of the time, but he was our guardian spirit in
the dreadful tumults of the city. When we were burned out
of one asylum, he led us to another. It is but a week since
he placed us in this melancholy spot, but yet the more secure
and unknown. He himself brought us provisions, supplied
us with every comfort that could be obtained by his impoverished
means, and saved us from famine. But now,”—the
tears filled her eyes and she could not proceed.</p>

<p>“Yes—now,” said I, “he is a sight that would shock the
eye; we must keep Salome in ignorance as long as we can.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fate of
Constantius</div>

<p>“The unhappy girl knows his fate but too well. He left us
a few days since, to obtain some intelligence of the siege.
We sat, during the night, listening to the frightful sounds of
battle. At daybreak, unable any longer to bear the suspense
or sit looking at Salome’s wretchedness, I ventured to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
fountain-gate, and there heard what I so bitterly anticipated—our
brave Constantius was slain!”</p>

<p>She wept aloud, and sobs and cries of irrepressible anguish
answered her from the chamber of my unhappy child.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A False Report</div>

<p>The danger of a too sudden discovery prevented me from
drying those tears, and I could proceed only by offering conjectures
on the various chances of battle, the possibility of his
being made prisoner, and the general difficulty of ascertaining
the fates of men in the irregular combats of a populace. But
Salome sat fixed in cold incredulity. Esther sorrowfully
kissed my hand, for my disposition to give them a ray of
comfort; Miriam gazed on me with a sad and searching look,
as if she felt that I would not tamper with their distresses,
yet she was deeply perplexed for the issue. At last the delay
grew painful to myself, and taking Salome to my arms, and
pressing a kiss of parental love on her pale cheek, I whispered,
“He lives!”</p>

<p>I was overwhelmed with transports and thanksgivings.
Precaution was at an end. If battle had been raging in the
streets, I could not now have restrained the generous impatience
of friendship and love. We left the mansion. There
was not much to leave besides the walls; but such as it was,
the first fugitive was welcome to the possession. Night was
still within the building, which had belonged to some of the
Roman officers of state, and was massive and of great extent.
But at the threshold the gray dawn came quivering over the
Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>We struggled through the long and winding streets, which
even in the light were nearly impassable. From the inhabitants
we met with no impediment; a few haggard and fierce-looking
men stared at us from the ruins,<a name="ENanchor_47" id="ENanchor_47"></a><a href="#Endnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but we, wrapped up
in rude mantles and hurrying along, wore too much the livery
of despair to be disturbed by our fellows in wretchedness.
With a trembling heart I led the way to the chamber, where
lay one in whose life our general happiness was centered.
Fearful of the shock which our sudden appearance might give
his enfeebled frame, and not less of the misery with which he
must be seen, I advanced alone to the bedside. He gave no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
sign of recognition, tho he was evidently awake, and I was
about to close the curtains and keep, at least, Salome from
the hazardous sight of this living ruin, when I found her beside
me. She took his hand and sat down on the bed, with
her eyes fixed on his hollow features. She spoke not a word,
but sat cherishing the wasted hand in her own and kissing it
with sad fondness. Her grief was too sacred for our interference,
and in sorrow scarcely less poignant than her own, I led
apart Miriam and Esther, who, like me, believed that the
parting day was come.</p>

<p>Such rude help as could be found in medicine—at a time
when our men of science had fled the city, and a few herbs
were the only resource—had not been neglected even in my
distraction. But life seemed retiring hour by hour, and if I
dared to contemplate the death of this beloved being, it was
almost with a wish that it had happened before the arrival of
those to whom it must be a renewal of agony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Faces
Difficulties</div>

<p>Still, the minor cares, which make so humble yet so necessary
a page in the history of life, were to occupy me. Food
must be provided for the increased number of my inmates,
and where was that to be found in the circle of a beleaguered
city? Money was useless, even if I possessed it; the friends
who would once have shared their last meal with me were
exiled or slain, and it was in the midst of a fierce populace,
themselves dying of hunger, that I was to glean the daily
subsistence of my wife and children. The natural pride of the
chieftain revolted at the idea of supplicating for food, but
this was one of the questions that show the absurdity of
pride, and I must beg if I would not see them die.</p>

<p>The dwelling had belonged to one of the noble families extinguished,
or driven away, in the first commotions of the war.
The factions which perpetually tore each other, and fought
from house to house, had stripped its lofty halls of everything
that could be plundered in the hurry of civil feud, and
when I took refuge under its roof it looked the very palace
of desolation. But it was a shelter, undisturbed by the riots
of the crowd, too bare to invite the robber; and even in its
vast and naked chambers, its gloomy passages and frowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
casements, congenial to the mood of my mind. With Constantius
insensible and dying before me, and with my own
spirit darkened by an eternal cloud, I loved loneliness and
darkness. When the echo of the winds came round me, as I
sat during my miserable midnights, watching the countenance
of my son, and moistening his feverish lip with the water
that even then was becoming a commodity of rare price in
Jerusalem, I had communed with memories that I would not
have exchanged for the brightest enjoyments of life. I welcomed
the sad music, in which the beloved voices revisited
my soul; what was earth now to me but a tomb? Pomp—nay,
comfort—would have been a mockery. I clung to the
solitude and obscurity that gave me the picture of the grave.</p>

<p>But the presence of my family made me feel the wretchedness
of my abode. When I cast my eyes round the squalid
and chilling halls, and saw wandering through them those
gentle and delicate forms, and saw them trying to disguise, by
smiles and cheering words, the depression that the whole scene
must inspire, I felt a pang that might defy a firmer philosophy
than mine—the despair that finds its only relief in scorn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Palace
of the Winds</div>

<p>“Here,” said I to Miriam, as I hastened to the door, “I
leave you mistress of a palace. The Asmonean blood once
flourished within these walls; and why not we? I have seen
the nobles of the land crowded into these chambers. They
are not so full now, but we must make the most of what we
have. Those hangings, that I remember, the pride of the
Sidonian who sold them, are left to us still; if they are in
fragments, they will but show our handiwork the more. We
must make our own music; and in default of menials, serve
with our own hands. The pile in that corner was once a
throne sent by a Persian king to the descendant of the Maccabee;
it will serve us at least for firing. The walls are thick;
the roof may hold out a few storms more; the casements, if
they keep out nothing else, keep out the daylight, an unwelcome
guest, which would do anything but reconcile us to the state
of the mansion, and now, farewell for a few hours.”</p>

<p>Miriam caught my arm, and said, in that sweet tone which
always sank into my heart:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Miriam Chides
Salathiel</div>

<p>“Salathiel, you must not leave us in this temper. I would
rather hear your open complaints of fortune than this affectation
of contempt for your calamities. They are many and
painful, I allow, tho I will not, dare not, repine. They may
even be such as are beyond human cure, but who shall say
that he has deserved better—or if he has, that suffering may
not be the determined means of exalting his nature? Is gold
the only thing that is to be tried in the fire?”</p>

<p>She waited my answer with a look of dejected love.</p>

<p>“Miriam, I need not say that I respect and honor your
feelings, but no resignation can combat the substantial evils
of life. Will the finest sentiments that ever came from human
lips make this darkness light, turn this bitter wind into
warmth, or make these hideous chambers but the dungeon?”</p>

<p>“My husband, I dread this language,” was the answer, with
more than usual solemnity; “it is—must I say it?—even unwise.
Shall the creatures of the Power by whom we are
placed in life either defy His wrath or disregard His mercy?
Might we not be more severely tasked than we are? Are
there not thousands at this hour in the world who, with at least
equal claims to the divine benevolence (I tremble when I use
the presumptuous phrase), are undergoing calamities to which
ours are happiness? Look from this very threshold; are there
not thousands within the walls of Jerusalem, groaning in the
pangs of unhealed wounds, mad, starving, stripped of every
succor of man, dying in hovels, the last survivors of their
wretched race? and yet we, still enjoying health, with a roof
over our heads, with our children round us safe, when the
plague of the first-born has fallen upon almost every house in
Judea, can complain! Be comforted, my love; I see but one
actual calamity among us; and if Constantius should survive,
even that one would be at an end.”</p>

<p>I left my gentle despot, and hurried through the echoing
halls of this palace of the winds. As I approached the great
avenues leading from the gates to the Temple, unusual sounds
struck my ears. Hitherto nothing in the sadness of the besieged
city was sadder than its silence. Death was lord of
Jerusalem, and the numberless ways in which life was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
extinguished had left but the remnant of its once proud and
flourishing population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gathering at Jerusalem</div>

<p>But now shouts, and still more, the deep and perpetual
murmur that bespeaks the movements and gatherings of a
crowded city, astonished me. My first conception was that
the enemy had advanced in force, and I was turning toward
the battlements to witness, or repel the general fate, when I
was involved in the multitude whose voices had perplexed
me.</p>

<p>It was the season of the Passover. The Roman barrier had
hitherto kept back the tribes; but the victory that left it in
embers opened the gates; and from the most death-like solitude,
we were once more to see the sons of Judea filling the
courts of the city of cities.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>After the Struggle</i></span></h3>

<p>Nothing could be more unrestrained than the public rejoicing.
The bold myriads that soon poured in, hour by hour,
many of them long acquainted with Roman battle and distinguished
for the successful defense of their strongholds,
many of them even bearing arms taken from the enemy, or
displaying honorable scars, seemed to have come, sent by
Heaven. The enemy, evidently disheartened by their late
losses and the destruction of the rampart which had cost
them so much labor, remained collected in their camps, and
access was free from every quarter. The rumors of our triumph
had spread with singular rapidity through the land,
and even the fearful phenomenon that wrote our undoing in
the skies stimulated the national hope. No son of Abraham
could believe, without the strongest repugnance, that Heaven
had interposed, and yet interposed against the chosen people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Living
Torrent</div>

<p>A living torrent had come, swelling into the gates, and the
great avenues and public places were quickly impassable with
the multitude. Jerusalem never before contained so vast a
mass of population. Wherever the eye turned were tents, fires,
and feasting; still the multitude wore an aspect not such as
in former days. The war had made its impression on the inmost
spirit of our country. The shepherds and tillers of the
ground had been forced into the habits of soldiership, and I
saw before me, for the gentle and joyous inhabitants of the
field and garden, bands of warriors made fierce by the sullen
necessities of the time.</p>

<p>The ruin in which they found Jerusalem increased their
gloom. Groups were seen everywhere climbing among the
fallen buildings to find out the dwelling of some chief of their
tribe, and venting furious indignation on the hands that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
overthrown it. The work of war upon the famous defenses of
the city was a profanation in their eyes. Crowds rushed
through the plain to trace the spot where their kindred fell
and gather their bones to the tardy sepulcher. Others rushed
exultingly over the wrecks of the Roman soldiery, burning
them in heaps, that they might not mix with the honored
dead.</p>

<p>But it was the dilapidation of the Temple that struck
them with the deepest emotion. The singularly nervous sensibility
and unequaled native reverence of the Jew were fully
awakened by the sight of the humiliated sanctuary. They
knelt and kissed the pavements, stained with the marks of civil
feud. They sent forth deep lamentations for the dismantled
beauty of gate and altar. They wrapped their mantles round
their heads, and, covering themselves with dust and ashes,
chanted hymns of funereal sorrow over the ruins. Hundreds
lay embracing pillar and threshold as they would the corpse
of a parent or a child; or, starting from the ground, gathered
on the heights nearest to the enemy and poured out curses
upon the “Abomination of desolation”—the idolatrous banner
that flaunted over the Roman camps, and by its mere
presence polluted the Temple of their fathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gloom
and Festivity</div>

<p>In the midst of this sorrow—and never was there more real
sorrow—was the strange contrast of an extravagant spirit of
festivity. The Passover, the grand celebration of our law,
had been until now marked by a grave homage. Even its
recollections of triumphant deliverance and illustrious promise
were but slightly suffered to mitigate the general awe. But
the character of the Jew had undergone a signal change.
Desperate valor and haughty contempt of all power but
that of arms were the impulse of the time. The habits of
the camp were transferred to every part of life, and the reckless
joy of the soldier when the battle is done, the eagerness
of the multitude of the dissolute for immediate indulgence,
and the rude and unhallowed resources to while away, the
heavy hour of idleness, were powerfully and repulsively prominent
in this final coming-up of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Varied Scene</div>

<p>As I struggled through the avenues in search of the remnant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of my tribe, my ears were perpetually startled by sounds
of riot. I saw, beside the spot where relations were weeping
over their dead, crowds drinking, dancing, and clamoring.
Songs of wild exultation were mingled with the laments for
their country; wine flowed, and the board, loaded with careless
profusion, was surrounded by revelers, with whom the
carouse was invariably succeeded by the quarrel. The pharisee
and scribe, the pests of society, were once more as busy as
ever, bustling through the concourse with supercilious dignity,
canvassing for hearers in the market-places as of old, offering
up their wordy devotions where they might best be seen, and
quarreling with the native bitterness of religious faction.
Blind guides of the blind, vipers and hypocrites, I think
that I see them still, with their turbans pulled down over
their scowling brows; their mantles gathered round them,
that they might not be degraded by a profane touch; and
every feature of their acrid and worldly physiognomies
wrinkled with pride, put to the torture by the assumption of
humility.</p>

<p>Minstrels, far unlike those who once led the way with
sacred song to the gates of the holy city, now flocked round
the tents, and companies of Greek and Syrian mimes, dancers,
and flute-players, the natural and fatal growth of a period of
military relaxation, were erecting their pavilions as in the
festivals of their own profligate cities.</p>

<p>Deepening the shadows of this fearful profanation, stood
forth the traders in terror: the exorcist, the soothsayer, the
magician girdled with live serpents, the pretended prophet,
naked and pouring out furious rhapsodies; impostors of every
color and pursuit, yet some of those abhorred and frightful
beings probably the dupes of their own imposture; some
utterly frenzied; and some declaring, and doing, wonders that
showed a power of evil never learned from man.</p>

<p>In depression of heart I gave up the effort to urge my way
through scenes that, firm as I was, terrified me, and turned
toward my home through the steep path that passed along
the outer court of the Temple. There all wore the mournful
silence suited to the sanctuary that was to see its altars kindled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
no more. But the ruins were crowded with kneeling and
wo-begone worshipers, who, from morning until night, clung
to the sacred soil and wept for the departing majesty of Judah.
I now knelt with them and mingled my tears with theirs.</p>

<p>Prayer calmed my spirit, and before I left the height I
stopped to look again upon the wondrous expanse below. The
clear atmosphere of the East singularly diminishes distance,
and I seemed to stand close by the Roman camps. The valley
at my feet was living with the new population of Jerusalem,
clustering thick as bees, and sending up the perpetual hum of
their mighty hive. The sight was superb, and I involuntarily
exulted in the strength that my country was still able to display
in the face of her enemies.</p>

<p>Here were the elements of mutual havoc, but might they
not be the elements of preservation? The thought occurred
that now might be the time to make an effort for peace. We
had, by the repulse of the legionaries, shown them the price
which they must pay for conquest. Even since that repulse, a
new national force had started forward, armed with an enthusiasm
that would perish only with the last man, and increasing
tenfold the difficulties of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sanhedrin
Acts</div>

<p>I turned again to the ruins, where I joined some venerable
and influential men, who alike shuddered at the excesses of
the crowd below and the catastrophe that prolonged war must
bring. My advice produced an impression. The remnant of
the Sanhedrin were speedily collected, and my proposal was
adopted that a deputation should immediately be sent to
Titus to ascertain how far he was disposed to an armistice.
The regular pacification might then follow with a more solemn
ceremonial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Titus Receives Jewish Envoys</div>

<p>From the top of Mount Moriah we anxiously watched the
passage of our envoys through the multitude that wandered
over the space from Jerusalem to the foot of the enemy’s
position. We saw them pass unmolested and enter the
Roman lines, and from the group of officers of rank who
came forward to meet them we gladly conjectured that their
reception was favorable. Within an hour we saw them moving
down the side of the hill on their return, and at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
distance behind, a cluster of horsemen slowly advancing. The
deputation had executed its task with success. It was received
by Titus with Italian urbanity.<a name="ENanchor_48" id="ENanchor_48"></a><a href="#Endnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> To its representations
of the power subsisting in Judea to sustain the war he fully
assented, and giving high praise to the fortitude of the people,
only lamented the necessary havoc of war. To give the
stronger proof of his wish for peace, his answer was to be
conveyed formally by a mission of his chief councilors and
officers to the Sanhedrin.</p>

<p>The tidings were soon propagated among the people, and
proud of their strength, and irritated against the invader as
they were, the prospect of relief from their innumerable privations
was welcomed with undisguised joy. The hope was as
cheering to the two prominent leaders of the factions as to
any man among us. John of Giscala had been stimulated into
daring by circumstances alone; nature never intended him for
a warrior. Wily, grasping, and selfish, cruel without personal
boldness, and keen without intellectual vigor, his only
purpose was to accumulate money and to enjoy power. The
loftier objects of public life were beyond his narrow capacity.
He had been rapidly losing even his own objects; his followers
were deserting him, and a continuance of the war involved
equally the personal peril which he feared, and the
fall of that tottering authority whose loss would leave him to
insulted justice.</p>

<p>Simon, the son of Gioras, was altogether of a higher class
of mankind. He was by nature a soldier, and, in other times,
might have risen to a place among the celebrated names of
war. But the fierceness of the period inflamed his spirit into
savage atrocity. In the tumults of the city he had distinguished
himself by that unhesitating hardihood which values
neither its own life nor the lives of others, and his daring threw
the hollow and artificial character of his rival deeply into the
shade. But he found a different adversary in the Roman. His
brute bravery was met by intelligent valor; his rashness was
baffled by the discipline of the legions; and weary of conflicts
in which he was sure to be defeated, he had long left the
field to the irregular sallies of the tribes, and contented himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
with prowess in city feud and the preservation of his
authority against the dagger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Meaning
of Peace</div>

<p>Peace with Rome would thus have relieved both John and
Simon from the danger which threatened to overwhelm them
alike; to the citizens it would have given an instant change
from the terrors of assault to tranquillity; and to the nation,
the hope of an existence made splendidly secure by its having
been won from the master of the world.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>A Man of Mystery</i></span></h3>

<p>The movement of the Roman mission through the plain
was marked by loud shouts. As it approached the gates, our
little council descended from the temple porch to meet it,
where one of the open places in the center of the city was appointed
for the conference. The applauding roar of the people
followed the troops through the streets, and when the tribunes
and senators entered the square, and gave us the right hand
of amity, universal acclamation shook the air. A gleam of
joy revisited my heart, and I was on the point of ascending
an elevation in the center, to announce the terms of this fortunate
armistice, when to my astonishment I saw the spot
preoccupied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Intruder</div>

<p>Whence came the intruder no one could tell, but there he
stood, a figure that fixed the universal eye. He was of
gigantic stature, brown as an Indian, and thin as one worn
to the last extremity by disease or famine. Conjecture was
busy. He seemed alternately the fugitive from a dungeon—one
of the half-savage recluses that sometimes came from
their dens in the wilderness, to exhibit among us the last humiliation
of mind and body—a dealer in forbidden arts, attempting
to impose on the credulity of the populace, and a
prophet armed with the fearful knowledge of our approaching
fall. To me there was an expression in his countenance that
partook of all; yet there was a something different from all
in the glaring eye, the livid scorn of the lip, and the wild
and yet grand outline of features which appeared alike overflowing
with malignity and majesty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tempest of a Soul</div>

<p>No man thought of interrupting him. A powerful interest
hushed every voice of the multitude, and the only impulse
was eagerness to hear the lofty wisdom or the fatal tidings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
that must be deposited with such a being. He himself seemed
to be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the thoughts that
he was commissioned to disclose. He stood for a while with
the look of one oppressed by a fearful dream, his bosom heaving,
his teeth gnashing, every muscle of his meager frame
swelling and quivering. He clasped his bony arms across his
breast, as if to repress the agitation that impeded his words;
he stamped on the ground, in apparent wrath at the faculties
which thus sank under him at the important moment; at last
the tempest of his soul broke forth:</p>

<p>“Judah! thou wert as a lion—thou wert as the king of the
forest, when he went up to the mountains to slay, and from
the mountains came down to devour. Thou wert as the garden
of Eden; every precious stone was thy covering; the sardine,
the topaz, and the beryl were thy pavements; thy fountains
were of silver, and thy daughters who walked in thy
groves were as the cherubim and the seraphim.</p>

<p>“Judah! thy temple was glorious as the sun-rising, and
thy priests were the wise of the earth. Kings came against
thee, and their bones were an offering; the fowls of the air
devoured them; the foxes brought their young, and feasted
them upon the mighty.</p>

<p>“Judah! thou wert as a fire in the midst of the nations—a
fire upon an altar; who shall quench thee? A sword over
the neck of the heathen; who shall say unto thee, Smite no
more! Thou wert as the thunder and the lightning; thou
camest from thy place, and the earth was dark. Thou didst
thunder, and the nations shook, and the fire of thy indignation
consumed them.”</p>

<p>The voice in which this extraordinary being uttered those
words was like the thunder. The multitude listened with
breathless awe. The appeal was to them a renewal of the
times of inspiration, and they awaited with outstretched
hands and quivering countenances the sentence that their passions
interpreted into the will of Heaven.</p>

<p>The figure lifted up his glance, which had hitherto been
fixed on the ground; and whether it was the work of fancy or
reality, I thought that the glance threw an actual beam of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
across the upturned visages of the myriads that filled every
spot on which a foot could rest—roof, wall, and ground.</p>

<p>Bowing his head, and raising his hands in the most solemn
adoration toward the Temple, he pursued, in a voice scarcely
above a whisper, yet indescribably impressive:</p>

<p>“Sons of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob! people elect
and holy! will you suffer that house of holiness to be the
scoff of the idolater? Will you see the polluted sacrifice laid
upon its altars? Will you be slaves in the presence of the
house of David?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Outcry
of the
Multitude</div>

<p>A rising outcry of the multitude showed how deeply they
felt his words. A fierce smile lightened across his features at
the sound. He erected his colossal form, and cried out like
the roar of a whirlwind:</p>

<p>“Then, men of Judah! be strong, and follow the hand that
led you through the sea and through the desert. Is that hand
shortened that it cannot save? Break off this accursed league
with the sons of Belial. Fly every man to arms, for the glory
of the mighty people. Go, and let the sword that smote the
Canaanite smite the Roman.”</p>

<p>He was answered with furious exultation. Swords and
poniards were brandished in the air. The safety of the Roman
officers became endangered, and I, with some of the elders,
dreading a result which must throw fatal obstacles in the way
of pacification, attempted to control the popular violence by
reason and entreaty. But the spirit of the Romans, haughty
with conquest and long contempt of the multitude, disdained
to take precautions with a mob, and they awaited with palpable
contempt the subsiding of this city effervescence. This
silent scorn, which probably stung the deeper for its silence,
was retorted to by clamors of unequivocal rage. The mysterious
disturber saw the storm coming, and flinging a furious
gesture toward the Roman camps, which lay glittering in the
sunshine along the hills, he rushed into the loftiest language
of malediction.</p>

<p>“Take up a lament for the Roman,” he shouted. “He
comes like a leviathan; he troubleth the waters with his presence,
and the rivers behold him and are afraid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prophecy
of Doom</div>

<p>“Thus saith the king, He who holdeth Israel in the hollow
of His hand: I will spread My net over thee, and My people
shall drag thee upon the shore; I will leave thee to rot upon
the land; I will fill the beasts of the earth with thee, until
they shall come and find thee, dry bones and dust—even thy
glory turned into a taint and a scorn.</p>

<p>“Lift up a cry over Rome and say, Thou art the leopard;
thy jaws are red with blood, and thy claws are heavy because
of the multitude of the slain; thy spots are glorious,
and thy feet are like wings for swiftness. But thy time is at
hand. My arrow shall smite through thee; My sword shall
go through thee; I will lay thy flesh upon the hills; thy
blood shall be red in the rivers; the pits shall be full of thee.</p>

<p>“For thus saith the king: I have not forsaken My children.
For My pleasure I have given them over for a while to the
hands of the oppressor; but they have loved Me—they have
come before Me, and offered up sacrifices; and shall I desert
the land of the chosen, the sons of the glorious, My people
Israel!”</p>

<p>A universal outcry of wrath and triumph followed this allusion
to the national vengeance.</p>

<p>“Ho!” exclaimed the figure. “Men of Israel, hear the
words of wisdom. The burden of Rome. By the swords of
the mighty will I cause her multitude to fall; the terrible and
the strong shall be on thee, city of the idolater; they shall
hew off thy cuirasses as the hewer of wood, and of thy
shields they shall make vessels of water. There shall be fire
in thy palaces, and the sword. Thy sons and thy daughters
shall they consume, and thy precious things shall be a spoil
when the king shall give the sign from the sanctuary.”</p>

<p>He paused, and, lifting up his fleshless arm, stood like a
giant bronze pointing to the Temple.</p>

<p>To the utter astonishment of all, a vapor was seen to
ascend from the summit of Mount Moriah, wreathing and
white like the smoke that used to mark the daily sacrifice.
Our first conception was that this great rite was resumed,
and the shout of joy was on our lips. But the vapor had
scarcely parted from the crown of the hill when it blackened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
and began to whirl with extraordinary rapidity; it thenceforth
less ascended than shot up, perpetually darkening and distending.
The horizon grew dim; the cloudy canopy above
continued to spread and revolve; lightning began to quiver
through, and we heard, at intervals, low peals of thunder.
But no rain fell, and the wind was lifeless. Nothing could
be more complete than the calm; not a hair of our heads was
moved, yet the heart of the countless multitude was penetrated
with the dread of some impending catastrophe that restrained
every voice, and the silence itself was awful.</p>

<p>In the climate of Judea we were accustomed to the rapid
rise and violent devastations of tempests. But the rising of
this storm, so closely connected with the appearance of the
strange summoner that it almost followed his command, invested
a phenomenon, at all times fearful, with a character
that might have struck firmer minds than those of the enthusiasts
round him. To heighten the wonder, the progress
of the storm still seemed faithful to the command. Wherever
this man of mystery waved his arm, there rushed a sheet of
cloud. The bluest tract of heaven was as black as night, at
the moment when he turned his ominous presence toward it,
until there was no more sky to be obliterated, and but for the
fiery streaks that tore through, we should have stood under a
canopy of solid gloom.</p>

<p>At length the whirlwind, that we had seen driving and
rolling the clouds like billows, burst upon us, scattering fragments
of the buildings far and wide, and cutting a broad way
through the overthrown multitude. Then superstition and
terror were loud-mouthed. The populace, crushed and dashed
down, exclaimed that a volcano was throwing up flame from
the mount of the Temple; that sulfurous smokes were rising
through the crevices of the ground; that the rocking of an
earthquake was felt; and still more terrible, that beings, not
to be looked on, nor even to be named, were hovering round
them in the storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Wild Panic</div>

<p>The general rush of the people, in which hundreds were
trampled and in which nothing but the most violent efforts
could keep any on their feet, bore me away for a while. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
struggle was sufficient to absorb all my senses, for nothing
could be more perilous. The darkness was intense, the peals
of the storm were deafening, and the howlings and fury of
the crowd, trampling and being trampled on, and fighting for
life in blindness and despair, with hand, foot, and dagger,
made an uproar louder than that of the storm. In this conflict,
rather of demons than of men, I was whirled away in
eddy after eddy, until chance brought me again to the foot of
the elevation.</p>

<p>There I beheld a new wonder. A column of livid fire stood
upon it, reaching to the clouds. I could discern the outline
of a human form within. But while I expected to see it drop
dead or blasted to a cinder, the flame spread over the ground,
and I saw its strange inhabitant making signs like those of
incantation. He drew a circle upon the burning soil, poured
out some unguent which diffused a powerful and rich odor,
razed the skin of his arm with a dagger, and let fall some
drops of blood into the blaze.</p>

<p>I shuddered at the sight of those palpable appeals to the
power of Evil, but I was pressed upon by thousands, and retreat
was impossible. The strange being then, with a ghastly
smile of triumph, waved the weapon toward the Roman
camps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Beginnings
of Vengeance</div>

<p>“Behold,” he cried, “the beginnings of vengeance!”</p>

<p>A thunder-roll that almost split the ear echoed round the
hills. The darkness passed away with it. Above Jerusalem
the sky cleared, and cleared into a translucence and blue
splendor unrivaled by the brightest sunshine. The people,
wrought up to the highest expectancy, shouted at this
promise of a prouder deliverance, and exclaiming, “Goshen!
Goshen!” looked breathlessly for the completion of the
plague upon the more than Egyptian oppressor. They were
not held long in suspense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bursting of the Storm</div>

<p>The storm had cleared away above our heads, only to gather
in deeper terrors round the circle of hills on which we could
see the enemy in the most overwhelming state of alarm. The
clouds rushed on, ridge over ridge, until the whole horizon
seemed shut in by a wall of night towering to the skies. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
heard the deep voice of the orator; at the utterance of some
strange words, a gleam played round his dagger’s point, and
the wall of darkness was instantly a wall of fire. The storm
was let loose in its rage. While we stood in daylight and in
perfect calm, the lightning poured like sheets of rain or
gushes of burning metal from a furnace upon the enemy.
The vast circuit of the camps was instantly one blaze. The
wind tore everything before it with irresistible violence. We
saw the tents swept off the ground and driven far over the
hills in flames like meteors; the piles of arms and banners
blown away; the soldiery clinging to the rocks, flying together
in helpless crowds, or scattering, like maniacs, with
hair and garments on fire; the baggage and military machines,
the turrets and ramparts, sinking in flames; the beasts of
burden plunging and rushing through the lines, or lying in
smoldering heaps where the lightning first smote them. All
was conflagration!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman
Embassy
Grows Indignant</div>

<p>The Roman embassy had hitherto remained in stern composure.
The visitations of nature they were accustomed to
sustain; the perturbations of a Jewish mob were beneath the
notice of the universal conquerors. But the sight of the havoc
among their countrymen shook their stoicism, and the cavalry
that formed the escort burst into indignant murmurs at the
exultation of the multitude, until the commander of the
troop, whose arms and bearing showed him to be of the highest
rank, unable to restrain his feelings, spurred to the front
of the embarrassed mission.</p>

<p>“How long, senators,” exclaimed he, “shall we stand here
to be scoffed at by these wretches? The imperial guard feels
itself disgraced by such a service. Will you have the squadron
openly mutiny? If they should ride away and leave us to
ourselves, who could blame them? What will the noble Titus
say, when we return to tell him that we stood by and listened
to the taunts of those cooped-up slaves, on him, the army, and
Rome? But how long shall we be suffered even to listen?
Linger here, and before the day is out your lives will be at
the mercy of those assassins. And by the immortal gods,
richly shall we all deserve our fate, for having come into this
den but as masters riding over the necks of those lost and
lowest of mankind.”</p>

<p>It was fortunate for the speaker that he spoke in a language
but little known to our bold peasantry. The senators held
their peace, and waited for the subsiding of the popular effervescence.</p>

Give me the order to disperse this rabble, and a single charge
will decide the affair.”</p>

<p>He threw himself forward on his horse’s neck, and fixed
his look eagerly on the senator’s countenance. But the old
Roman was immovable. The man of prophecy, who had stood
with his robe wrapped round his arms in an attitude of contemptuous
ease, awaiting the result of the demand, burst into
loud laughter. The young soldier’s indignation was roused
by this new object. He turned to the scorner, and crying out,
“Ho! is it you, miscreant? You at least shall not escape me,”
flung his lance full against his bosom. I saw the weapon
strike with prodigious force, but it might as well have struck
a rock. It flew into splinters.</p>

<p>The Roman rushed at him with his drawn falchion. His
strange antagonist stood without moving a limb, and only
raised his cold, large eye. The charger, in his fiercest bound,
instantly swerved, and had nearly unseated his rider. Nothing
could bring him forward again. Spur and voice were useless.
The animal, a magnificent jet black, of the largest Arab breed,
strong as a bull and bold as a lion, could not abide that stern
eye. He galloped madly round and round, but the attempt to
force him against the stranger stopped him as if he were
stabbed. Then with every muscle in his frame palpitating,
his broad chest heaving, his nostrils breathing out vapor,
and the foam flying over his front like snow, he would plunge
and rear until, mastering his powerful rider, he wheeled
round and darted away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Marvel of
Marvels</div>

<p>The shouts of scorn that rose from the populace at every
fresh failure, doubly enraged the young Roman. He made a
final effort, and grasping the bridle in both hands, and dashing
in the spur, at length succeeded in forcing the wearied
charger on. The noble creature, at one immense leap, reached
the fatal spot. But there he was fixed as if some power had
transformed him into stone. He no longer staggered nor
swerved, but crouching down, with his feet thrust forward,
his crest stooped, his nostrils on the ground, and his bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
eye strained and filmy, as if he were growing blind, stood
gazing with a look of almost human horror. The furious rider
struck him on the head with the flat of his falchion. The
charger gathered up his limbs at the blow, reared straight as
a column, and bellowing, plunged upon his head. There was
a general cry of terror, even among the multitude, and they
rushed forward to help him to rise. But he rose no more. He
rolled over and over his rider, and, stretching out his limbs in
a convulsion, died.</p>

<p>The tumult was on the point of being renewed, for the
soldiery pushed forward to bear away their officer, who lay
like a corpse; but the crowd had already covered the ground,
and blows were given on both sides. Indignant at the interruption
of the armistice, and the injury that threatened the
sacred person of ambassadors, I forced my way through the
crowd; by exerting a strength with which few could cope,
rescued the young Roman, and delivering him to the mission,
protested against their construing the casual violence of rioters
into the determination of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Calms Resentment</div>

<p>I had partially succeeded in calming their resentment, and
in restraining the bloodthirsty weapons that were already
glittering in numberless hands, when a sound like that of a
trumpet, distant but blown with tremendous force, struck
every ear at once.</p>

<p>I looked involuntarily to the man who had already been
our disturber. He pointed to the heavens. A fragment of
cloud, that seemed to have escaped from the mass of the tempest,
was floating along the zenith. He took up his parable:</p>

<p>“Have I not covered the heavens with a cloud? saith the
Mighty One. Have I not said to the sun, Be dark; and to the
moon and stars, Be ashamed? Have I not hidden Mine enemies
in the shroud, and said to the whirlwind, Go forth and
slay?”</p>

<p>His gesture turned all eyes to the wrecks of the Roman
camp, where the whirlwind continued to ravage and the
thunders still roared. Then throwing himself forward with a
look full of wild grandeur, and in a voice hollow and appalling
as the storm, he exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>“Behold! this day shall a wonder be wrought among you—this
day shall a mighty thing be brought to pass. Kings
shall see it and tremble; yea, the heathen shall melt before
thee. Their strength shall be as water and their hearts as the
burning flax. Sorrow shall be on them, as the locust on the
green field, and they shall flee as from a lion. Behold! in a
cloud shall a sword be brandished before thee; in smoke and
in fire shalt thou conquer. For His angel shall come, and the
sword and the flame shall at this hour be a sign unto Israel!”</p>

<p>Whether by the proverbial sagacity of the wanderers of the
desert, by one of those coincidences which so curiously come
to sustain the credit of daring conjecture, or by knowledge
from some darker sources, the little orbed vapor began to
lengthen and rapidly assumed the shape of a sword.</p>

<p>Dreading the popular power of imposture, and the uses to
which it would inevitably be applied, I was glad that this
extraordinary being had thus put himself upon his trial; and
I stood gazing in eager expectation that some passing gust
would dissipate at once the cloud and the reputation of the
prophet. Yet utterly scorning the common pretensions of
the rambling practisers of forbidden arts, I knew that awful
things had been done; that most of all, in these latter days
of our country, strange influences were let loose, perhaps to
plunge into deeper ruin a people guiltily prone to take refuge
in delusions. I had heard prophecies, hideous and unholy,
which were never taught by man; I had seen a command of
the elements that utterly defied philosophy to account for
it; if in the last vengeance of Heaven, evil spirits were
ever suffered to go forth and give their power to evil men,
for the purpose of binding in the faster chains of falsehood a
race who loved a lie, it was in those hours of signs and wonders
which might, if possible, deceive the very elect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Flaming
Sword</div>

<p>To my astonishment, the cloud suddenly changed its color;
from white it became intensely red; and in a few moments
more it burst into a flame that threw a broad reflection upon
the whole atmosphere. It was a vast falchion of fire. And
from that hour to the last of the glorious and unhappy city
of David, that flaming sword—the sign of a wrath predicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
a thousand years before—blazed day and night over Jerusalem!</p>

<p>Its instant effect was terrible. The multitude, already indignant
against the Romans, and restrained only by my
desperate efforts, were now roused to the highest pitch of
presumption. To doubt of the help of Heaven was impiety,
after this open wonder; to spare an hour between this divine
command and the extermination of the idolater was sacrilege.
They poured round the unfortunate troop and instantly overwhelmed
them, as an earthquake would have overwhelmed
them. A mass of human life, dense as the ground it trod
upon, broke over them. The Romans struggled heroically; I
saw their charges often make fearful way, and their swords
and lances dripping with blood every time they were whirled
round their heads. But the conflict was too unequal; one by
one those brave men were torn down; I saw them swept along
by the torrent, fewer and fewer, still above the living wave;
gradually separated more widely from each other; each man
faintly struggling for himself, flinging his feeble arms to the
right and left, till, dizzy with fatigue and despair, at last he
went down, and the roaring tide closed over him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superstition
and Inexpiable
Murder</div>

<p>All perished, and a day of hope was closed in superstition,
treachery, and inexpiable murder.</p>

<p>The dreadful uproar sank as suddenly as it had risen. The
Roman troop lay a heap of dead. I turned away from the
sight, but at the instant of turning I saw the prophet of evil,
whether impostor or magician, whether man or demon, spring
into their midst with a roar of laughter. I shrank away. But
I heard that terrible laugh ringing through all the streets of
Jerusalem!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LIII">CHAPTER LIII<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>A Fatal Sign</i></span></h3>

<p>It was night, and the greater portion of the city lay between
me and home. To traverse it was still a matter of
danger. Furious festivity had succeeded to furious conflict;
the roving mountaineers made little difference between a
stranger and an enemy, and whether inflamed with wine or
triumph, the carousers on that night were the masters of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>I kept my course through the less frequented ways, and
leaving on either side the great avenues, crowded with tents
and glittering with illumination, committed myself to the
quiet light of the moon.</p>

<p>But in choosing the more solitary streets, I was, without
recollecting it, led into the open place where the late disturbance
had begun, and I felt some vague dread of passing a
spot on which had appeared a being so singular as the leader
of the tumult.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Wounded
Soldier</div>

<p>By a compromise with my prudence, I kept as far from the
hillock as possible, and was moving rapidly by the wall of one
of the huge buildings of Herod, when I heard a groan. In
the nervousness of the time, and doubtful from what region
of earth or air my antagonist, in that place of spells, might
come, I drew my dagger with a sensation that I had never
felt in the field, and setting my back against the wall, stood
on my defense. But a wounded man, the utterer of the
groan, now tottered into the light and fell before me. I recognized
the commander of the escort. The dying struggles of
his charger had crushed him, and the multitude had abandoned
him to his fate.</p>

<p>To leave him where he was, was to leave him to perish.
I owed something to the survivor of the unfortunate mission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and my short consultation closed by carrying him on my
shoulders to the door of my comfortless dwelling.</p>

<p>The Roman had learned to distrust Jewish fidelity. The
gloom inside the entrance looked the very color of secret
murder. Even the dismantled appearance of the exterior was
enough for suspicion, and he firmly ordered that I should
terminate my good offices at the threshold. Irritated by his
obvious meaning, I left him to his wish, and placing him in
the fullest enjoyment of such security as the open street and
the moonlight could give, took my farewell, bidding him in
future to have a better opinion of mankind.</p>

<p>Yet I was to be startled in my turn. As I climbed the
broken staircases, I saw an unusual light in the chambers
above. Accustomed as I was to reverses, I felt tenfold alarm
from the preciousness of my stake. The ferocious bands that
crowded the streets, inflamed with wine and blood, could
have no scruples where plunder tempted them; and in the
strong persuasion that some misfortune had happened in my
long absence, I lingered in doubt whether I should not return
to the streets, collect what assistance I could find among the
passersby, and crush the robbers by main force. But sudden
exclamations and hurried feet above left me no time; I
darted up the shattered steps and breathlessly threw open the
door.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Messengers of
Good Tidings</div>

<p>Well might I wonder. I saw a superb room, hung with
tapestry, a table in the center covered with plate and viands,
a rich lamp illuminating the chamber, stately furniture, a
fire blazing on a tripod and throwing a cheering warmth and
delicious odor round; yet, to enjoy all this, not a living
creature. But whatever my anxieties might be, they were delightfully
scattered by the voice of Esther, who came flying
toward me with outstretched arms and a face bright with
joy. From an inner chamber followed more messengers of
good tidings—Miriam and Salome leading Constantius! They
had watched over him from the time of my departure with a
sickly alternation of hope and fear; as the evening approached
he seemed dying. Salome, with the jealousy of deep sorrow,
desired to be left alone with him; and the two sad listeners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
at the door expected at every moment the burst of agony announcing
her irreparable loss. They heard a cry of joy; the
torpor was gone, and Constantius was sitting up, raised to
new life, wondering at all round him, and uttering the raptures
of gratitude and love.</p>

<p>The sound that had impelled me to my abrupt entrance
was the joy of my family at bringing the recovered patient in
triumph from his weary bed into view of the comforts provided
for him and for me. The change wrought in the chamber
itself was explained by the presence of two old domestics
who, in the flight of the former possessors, had been overlooked,
and suffered to hide, rather than live, in a corner of
the ruin. They had contrived in the general spoliation to
secrete some of the precious things which the haste of plunder
had not time to seize. The presence of a noble family under
the honored roof once more brought out their feelings and
treasures together, and by the graceful dexterity of Miriam
and Esther were those naked walls converted into an apartment
not unworthy to be inhabited by themselves.</p>

<p>While I was indulging in the luxury which those gentle
ministers provided, the thought of the unfortunate Roman
occurred to me. I slightly mentioned him, and every voice
was raised to have him brought in from the hazards of the
night. Constantius, feeble as he was, rose from his couch to
assist in this work of hospitality; but he was under a fond
tyrant, who would not suffer her commands to be questioned.
Salome’s orders were obeyed; and to one of the old domestics
and me was destined the undivided honor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Goes
to a Roman’s
Aid</div>

<p>I found the wounded officer lying on the spot where I had
parted with him, gazing on the moon and humming a gay air
of Italy in a most melancholy tone. He had made up his
reckoning with this world, and calmly waiting until some
Jewish knife should put an end to his troubles, he determined
to save himself from the trouble of thinking, and die like a
man who had nothing better to do. But the struggle was
against nature, and as I slowly felt my way along the obscure
passages, I had time to hear the song flutter and now
and then a groan supersede it altogether. My step now caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
his quick ear, and I heard in return the ringing of a sword
plucked sharply from the scabbard.</p>

<p>The bold Roman, reckless as he was of life, was evidently
resolved not to let it go without its price, and it was probably
fortunate for me, or my old and tottering fellow philanthropist,
that the ruinous state of the passages compelled
us to take time in our advance.</p>

<p>“Two of them,” I heard him mutter as we gradually
worked our way toward the light; “two, and perhaps twenty
at their backs.”</p>

<p>He tried to raise himself, leaning on one hand, and with
the other feebly pointing the falchion to keep us off.</p>

<p>“Thieves,” said he, “let us understand each other. If you
must cut my throat, you must fight for it, and, after all, I
have nothing to make it worth your trouble. By Jove and
Venus,” and he laughed with the strange jocularity that
sometimes besets the bold in the last peril, “the cleverest
robber in Jerusalem could make nothing of me.”</p>

<p>I stood in the shadow, while he again tried his expostulation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman
Negotiates</div>

<p>“My clothes would not sell for the smallest coin in your
sashes; I could not furnish out a scarecrow—yet Jewish
patriots, or thieves, or saints, or all together, I will tell you
how you can make money of me. Take me to the Roman
camp, and I answer for your fortune on the spot.”</p>

<p>I laughed in my turn.</p>

<p>“By all that’s honest, I never was more serious in my
life,” said he; “far be it from me to trifle with heroes of your
profession. You shall have my helmetful of gold Vespasians.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said I, coming forward, “you shall live at
least for to-night; but there is one condition which I can not
give up——”</p>

<p>“Of course, that I give you two helmetsful instead of
one. Agreed.”</p>

<p>“The condition from which nothing can make me recede
is——”</p>

<p>“Three times the money, or ten times the money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>I pondered. The old domestic stared at us both.</p>

<p>“Why, you extravagant Jew, have you no conscience?
Recollect how little the lives of half the generals in the
service are worth half the sum. But say anything short of
the military chest—out with the condition at once.”</p>

<p>“That you come instantly with me—to supper.”</p>

<p>The formidable stipulation was gaily acceded to. The old
domestic and I supported him up the stairs, whose condition,
as he afterward allowed, led him still to nurture shrewd
doubt of Jewish hospitality. But when I opened the door of
the chamber and he saw the striking preparations within, he
uttered a cry of surprise, and turning, bowed with Italian
grace, in tacit acknowledgment of the wrong that he had done
me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Septimius
Recognized</div>

<p>As I led him forward and the light fell on his features, I
saw Esther’s countenance glow with crimson. The Roman
pronounced her name and flew over to her. Miriam—we all
in the same moment recognized the stranger, and every lip at
once uttered “Septimius!”</p>

<p>A few campaigns in the imperial guard had changed the
handsome Italian boy, the friend and favorite of Constantius,
into the showy officer, the friend and favorite of everybody;
with the elegance of the court, and the freedom of the camp,
he had inherited from nature the easy lightness and animation
of temper that neither can give. Nothing could be more amusing
than the restless round of anecdote that he kept up
through the night. The circle in which he found himself,
contrasted with the wretchedness of the few hours before, let
his recollections flow with wild vivacity. His stories of the
imperial tent were new to us, and he told them with the
taste of a man of high breeding and the sarcastic finish of a
keen observer of the absurdities that will creep in even
among the mighty and the wise of the world.</p>

<p>In our several ways he delighted us all. Constantius
seemed to gain new health in laughing at the histories of his
military friends. Salome’s face glistened with the vividness
so long chased away by sorrow, as the manners of Rome passed
before her in the liveliest colors of pleasantry. Esther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
treasured every word with an emotion that fluctuated across
her beauty like the opening and shutting of a rose under the
evening breeze. I was interested by the pungent sketches of
public character that started up in the midst of sportive description.
Miriam alone was reluctant, and her glance frequently
rested with pain on Esther’s hectic cheek. But even
Miriam at times gave way to the voice of the charmer; her
fears were forgotten, and she joined in the general smile.</p>

<p>When the women retired, we held a short consultation on
the means of restoring our guest to his friends. In the immediate
temper of the city, to be seen was certain death, and
no pacific intercourse with the besiegers could be expected
after our enormous infraction of treaty. Constantius urged
the despatch of a private messenger to the camp with the proposal
of a plan for his escape. To my surprise, and certainly
to my gratification, Septimius himself flatly negatived the
measure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Precarious
Position</div>

<p>“It has too much hazard for my taste,” said he sportively.
“Your messenger will probably be caught by the people and
as probably hanged; or if he reach the camp, he will be hanged
there inevitably. Jewish credit, I regret to say, will not
stand high within these twelve hours, with my countrymen.
If the fellow die here like a woman, with a story in his
mouth, you will all be brought under the justice of your
sovereign lord the mob. If my countrymen inflict the ax,
you are not the safer, for every peasant about the camp is a
spy, and the news will travel here in the next half-hour, and
after all, your trouble will be thrown away. Titus has good-nature
enough, and probably would not wish to see me hoisted
on the top of a pike on your gates; but he is a furious disciplinarian,
swears by the law of honor and arms, and is, I
can well believe, chafing like a roused lion against every one
who has had a share in this day’s business. I myself should
have a chance of hanging, for an example, if I returned before
his imperial displeasure had time to cool. So I must
trespass on your hospitality for a day or two.”</p>

<p>“But what is to be finally done?” said I. “The armistice
can never be tried again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not? Do you think that the loss of a few troopers
can make any difference? Out of twenty thousand cavalry,
we can easily spare a hundred. Those things have happened
once a week since the beginning of the campaign. They agree
with our notions admirably. The survivors get promotion,
and whatever libation they may offer for their good luck; it
is certainly not tears. A stupid officer, and on this occasion I
fairly reckon myself among the number, is taken off the
muster-roll, before he might have the opportunity of doing
mischief by some blunder on a larger scale. Experience is
gained; we are entrapped no more, at least in the same
way; and a group of unfortunates, who have spent half their
lives in being browbeaten by their superiors, suddenly start
into rank, become superiors themselves, and learn to browbeat
in their turn. You will have the armistice again in a
week.”</p>

<p>This confession of soldiership repelled me a little, but its
air of frankness and disregard of chance and care carried it
off showily. I, too, was but a peasant-soldier, with my heart
in everything. The man before me was a son of the camp,
the professional warrior, whose business it was to stifle all
feelings but those of the camp. Yet heroism and hard-heartedness—I
could not join them. I had still something to learn,
and the gay philosopher of the sword lost ground with me.</p>

<p>I was retiring for the night when I felt the soft hand of
Miriam on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“I have been anxious,” she said, “to ask your opinion about
this Roman.”</p>

<p>Her fine countenance, that reflected every emotion of her
spirit like a mirror, showed that the subject was one of deep
interest. “Is misfortune always to pursue us, Salathiel?”</p>

<p>“In what new shape now?” said I. “We have spent some
hours, as amusing as I ever remember. What can have occurred
since this morning, when your philosophy made so
light of our actual evils?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miriam’s Suspicion</div>

<p>“For external evils I have but little feeling,” was her
answer; “but I see in the chance that brought the Roman
here to-night something of the fate which you have so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
thought to follow your house. I tremble for Esther’s peace
of mind. What if she should be attracted by this idolater?”</p>

<p>“Esther! my darling Esther! love an alien, a Roman, an
idolater? What an abyss you open before me!” I exclaimed,
with a sudden sense of evil.</p>

<p>There was a pause; my wife again spoke.</p>

<p>“While Septimius remained among us in the mountains, I
saw with terror that Esther’s beauty attracted him. His Italian
elegance was even then a dangerous charm for a mind so
inexperienced and so sensitive as hers. I knew the impossibility
of their union, and rejoiced when his recovery allowed
of his leaving the palace. But for a long period after, Esther
was evidently unhappy; her cheerfulness gave way; she became
fonder of solitude, and I believe that nothing but extreme
care and the change of scene which followed, preserved
her from the grave.”</p>

<p>“Miriam! I have no comfort to offer. I am a stricken man;
misfortune must be my portion. But if anything were to bereave
me of that girl, I feel that my heart would break. We
must delay no longer. By the first light the Roman shall quit
this house—this city. He shall not stay another hour to
poison the peace of my family—the only peace that I now
can possess in this world.”</p>

<p>“Yet rashness must not disgrace what is true wisdom, my
Salathiel. The Roman is here protected by the laws of courtesy.
You can not send him forth without giving him over to
the horrid temper of the populace. A few days may make
that escape easy which would now be impossible. Besides, I
may have done him injustice, and mistaken the common
pleasure of seeing unexpected friends for the attempt to mislead
the affections of our innocent and ardent child.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel on
His Guard</div>

<p>“No! By the first light he leaves this roof. The truth
glares on me. I might have seen it in his looks. His language,
however general, was perpetually directed to Esther
by some personal allusion. His voice lost its ease when he
answered a syllable of hers. After she spoke he affected abstraction—an
old artifice. His manner is too well calculated
to disturb the mind of woman—and most of all of woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
cursed with feeling and genius. Esther has already exalted
this showy stranger into a wonder. I must break the spell.
What is to become of her, of me, man of misery? By the
first dawn the Roman takes his departure.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ominous
Sword Appears</div>

<p>In the bitterness of soul I turned from the chamber, where
the lamp was still burning and the glittering table looked too
bright for the gloomy spirit of the hour. The cool air that
breathed through a casement led me toward it, and disinclined
to speak and holding Miriam’s gentle hand, I listened
to the confused murmurs of the city far below. I suddenly
felt the hand in mine tremble convulsively. Miriam’s face
was pale with fear; she stood with lips apart and breathless,
brows raised, eyes straining upward. In utter alarm I asked
the cause. She lifted the hand, which had fallen by her side,
and slowly, like the staff of the soothsayer, pointed it to the
heavens. The cause was there. The ominous sword had for
the first time met her eye. The blaze, which even in noonday
was fearfully visible, in midnight was tremendous. A blade
of the deepest hue of gore stretched to the horizon, pouring
from its edge perpetual showers of crimson flame, that looked
like showers of fresh blood. Boundless slaughter was in
the emblem. Beyond it the circle of the sky was wan; the
stars sickened, and the moon, tho at the full, hung like an
orb of lead. The mighty falchion, the pledge of an inevitable
judgment,<a name="ENanchor_49" id="ENanchor_49"></a><a href="#Endnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> extinguished all the beneficent splendors of
heaven.</p>

<p>“There, there is the sign that I have seen for months in
my dreams,” said Miriam in an awed voice; “that has haunted
me when I laid my head upon the pillow; that has been before
my mind in the day wherever I moved; that I have seen
coloring every object, every moment of my life since I entered
these fated walls. I have struggled to drive away the horrid
image; I have wept and prayed. But it was where nothing
could unfix it. It was pictured on my soul, and with it came
other images, fearful, tho they brought me no terrors—melancholy
sights to those who have no hope but here, yet
glorious to the servants of the truth, Salathiel. I have had
warnings. I must never leave the city of David.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>She knelt in the deep prayer of the soul. Her words came
on me with the power of prophecy.</p>

<p>“King and protector of Israel!” I exclaimed, “is this to be
the suffering of Thy people? On me let Thy wrath be done,
but spare her who now kneels before Thee. Are the pure to be
given into the hands of the merciless and Thy children to be
trampled as the ashes of the unholy?”</p>

<p>My impatient voice caught Miriam’s ear, and she rose with
a countenance beaming piety and love.</p>

<p>“Salathiel, we must not murmur. Even that sight of awe,
that terrible emblem, has taught me the selfishness of my
anxieties. What are our personal sorrows to the weight of
affliction figured in that instrument of supreme justice? The
wo of millions, the blood of a nation, the ruin of the glorious
Law, built by the hands of the Eternal, for the glory and
good of mankind, are written in words of flame before our
eyes; and can I complain of the perils which may fall to my
share? Henceforth, my husband and my love”—and she
threw herself into my willing arms—“you shall never be disturbed
with my sorrows; exercise your own powerful understanding,
guard against evil by your talents and knowledge of
life, as far as it can be guarded against by man, and beyond
that, cease to repine or fear. In my supplication I have committed
our darling child into the hands of Him who sitteth
within the circle of eternity!”</p>

<p>Quivering with every finer feeling of the heart, maternal
love, matron faith, and grateful adoration, she hung upon my
neck, until as if a portion of her noble spirit had passed into
mine, I felt a confidence and a consolation like her own.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LIV">CHAPTER LIV<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Concerning Septimius</i></span></h3>

<p>I was spared the ungraciousness of urging the young
soldier’s departure, for when I met him on the next morning
his first topic was escape. He had been since daybreak examining
from my turrets the accessible passages of the fortifications,
and had even, by the help of a peasant, despatched
a letter to his friends, requesting either a formal demand of
his person from the Jews, or some private effort to extricate
him.</p>

<p>But this glow of society was transient. In the fall of his
charger he had been violently bruised. He now complained of
inward suffering, and his pallid face and feeble words gave
painful proof that he had much still to undergo, tho, even
if he was perfectly recovered, the crowded battlements and
the popular rage showed the impossibility of immediate return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vexed and Suspicious</div>

<p>Three days passed thus drearily. At home I was surrounded
by sickness or vexed by suspicion—the worst sickness of the
mind. Septimius lay in his chamber, struggling to laugh,
talk, and read away the heavy hours, and finally, like all
such strugglers, giving up the task in despair. His thoughts
were in the Roman camp. He professed gratitude of the deepest
nature for the service that I had done him now for the
second time, if saving so unimportant a life was a service
either to him or any one else. Yet he almost wished that he
had been left where he was found.</p>

<p>At such times his voice sank, and he was evidently thinking
of subjects near to his heart.</p>

<p>Then his soldiership would come again—a man could not
finish his course better than among his gallant comrades; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
with all his anxiety to return, he felt no trivial concern as
to the view which Titus might take of the whole unfortunate
affair. Of justice he was secure; but to be questioned for his
military conduct was in itself a degradation. The loss of
Sempronius, too, the most confidential friend and counselor
of the Emperor, would weigh heavily—while there was nothing
but his own testimony to sustain his honor against the crowd
of secret enemies that every man of military rank was certain
to have.</p>

<p>“In short,” said he, “on my sleepless couch I have turned
true penitent for the foolish curiosity which prompted me to
solicit the command of an escort, which would have been by
right put under the care of some mere tribune.”</p>

<p>I tried to cheer him by saying that his had been only the
natural desire of an active mind to see so singular a scene as
our city offered, or the honorable wish of a soldier to be foremost
wherever there was anything to be done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Watched by a
Slave</div>

<p>“It was more than either,” said he; “there was actual
illusion in the case. I now feel that I was practised upon.
You know the strange concourse of all kinds of people that
follow a camp for all kinds of purposes—plunderers, traders,
and jugglers, crowding on our movements as regularly as the
vultures, and with nearly the same objects. For a week past
I had found myself beset by an old gibbering slave of this
class. Wherever I rode, the fellow was before my eyes; he
contrived to mingle with my servants, and became a sort of
favorite by selling them counterfeit rings and gems at ten
times their value. The wretch was clever, too, and as my
tent-hours began to be disturbed by the unusual gaiety of the
listeners to his lies, I ordered him to be flogged out of the lines.
But twelve hours had not passed before I found him gamboling
again, and was about to order the instant infliction of the
discipline, when he threw himself on the ground and implored
‘a moment of my secret ear.’ Conceive who the fellow was?”</p>

<p>“The impostor who harangued in the square!”</p>

<p>“The very man. He told me that there were certain contrivances
on foot to bring me into disfavor with the general,
which I knew to be the fact. He gave me the names of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
parties, which I felt to be sufficiently probable, and finished
by saying that, having so long eaten of my bread (a week), and
enjoyed my liberality (the scourge), he longed to show his
gratitude by giving me an opportunity of putting my enemies
to silence on the spot. This opportunity was to solicit the
command of the escort required for the mission. How he
gained his wisdom I know not, but I took the advice, went at
once to Titus, found that an armistice was being debated in
council, that there was some difficulty in the choice of an
officer for the service (by no means likely to be a sinecure in
point of either judgment or hazard), stepped forward, and, to
the surprise of everybody, disclaimed the privileges of my rank
and insisted on marching at the head of this handful, this
outpost-guard, into the formidable city of Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“His object, of course,” said I, “was your destruction. I
now see the cause of the harangue that roused the people; he
was in the pay of the conspirators against you. Yet his appearance
was striking; there was a vigor about his look and
language, a fierce consciousness of power somewhere, that
distinguished him from his race. He came, too, and has disappeared,
without my being able to discover whence or
whither.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duped by a
Juggler</div>

<p>“Oh, the commonest contrivance of his trade,” was the
reply. “Those fellows always come and go in cloud, if they
can. He was probably beside you half the day before and
after. You saw how little he thought of the lance, that I sent
to bring out his hidden secrets. He doubtless wore armor;
otherwise there would have been one juggler the less in the
world. The truth is, I have been duped, but I have made up
my mind to think nothing about the dupery. The slave is
certainly clever, perhaps to an extraordinary degree—a villain
undoubtedly, and of the first magnitude. But he has the
secret of the cabal against me, and that secret makes him at
once fit to be employed, and dangerous to be provoked. The
blow of the lance yesterday showed him that I am not always
to be trifled with. In fact, prince, you might find it advantageous
to employ him occasionally yourself. It was he who
conveyed my letter to the camp this morning!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>My look probably expressed my dislike of this species of
envoy.</p>

<p>“You may rely on my honor,” said the Roman, “not to
involve you in any of the fellow’s inventions. Slippery as he
is, I have a hold on him, too, that he will not venture to
shake off. And now, to let you into full confidence, I expect
him back this very night, when he will relieve your city of an
inhabitant unworthy of remaining among so polished a people;
and your house, my prince, of an inmate than whom none on
earth can be more grateful for your hospitality.”</p>

<p>He concluded this mixture of levity, address, and frankness
with a smile, and in a tone of elegance, that compelled
me to take it all on the more favorable side. But against
suffering the step of his strange emissary to pollute the
threshold in which I lived, I expressed my plain determination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secret Preparations
for
Departure</div>

<p>“For that, too, I have provided,” said he. “My intercourse
with the reprobate is to take place at another quarter of the
city, as far as possible from this dwelling,” and he laughed,
“for reasons equally of mine and yours. I have managed matters
so as not to compromise any of my friends; and to make
my arrangements on that point still more secure, may I express
a wish that neither Constantius nor any other person of
your house may be acquainted with my intention of leaving
them, and I may sincerely say, leaving everything that could
gratify my best feelings—this very evening.”</p>

<p>This was an easy and graceful avoidance of the difficulties
which his longer residence threatened. I gave him the
promise of secrecy, cautioning him against reposing any dangerous
confidence in his emissary, of whom I had an irrepressible
abhorrence, and was about to leave the chamber when
he caught my hand and said in unusual emotion:</p>

<p>“Prince of Naphtali, I have but one word more to say. You
are a man of the world and can make allowance for the giddiness
of human passions. Some of them are uncontrollable,
or at least I have never learned to control them, and in me
perhaps they belong to inferiority of mind. But if on my departure
you should hear calumnies against me——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>“Impossible, my young friend; or if I should, you may
rely on my giving the calumniators a very brief answer.”</p>

<p>“Or if even yourself should be disposed to think severely
of me, you know the circumstances under which a man of
birth and fortune must be placed in our profession.”</p>

<p>“Fully, and am much more disposed to regret than to
wonder at the consequences.”</p>

<p>“If you should hear that I had been assailed in an evil
hour by an unexpected temptation which I had long labored
to resist, assailed by it under the most powerful circumstances
that ever yet tasked the human mind, circumstances to which,
from the beginning of the world, wisdom has been proverbially
folly, and resolution weakness; if it should have mastered my
whole being, soul and body; if I were willing to give up the
brightest prospects for its possession—to hazard life, hope,
honors——”</p>

<p>The thought of Esther smote me. I started from him where
he stood, with his fine head drooping like the Antinous and
his figure the very emblem of passionate dejection.</p>

<p>“Roman, you are here as my guest, and as such I have
listened to you with patience until now. But if any member
of my family is concerned in what you say, I demand in the
most distinct terms that the subject shall be mentioned no
more. The daughters of Israel are sacred. Never shall a
child of mine wed with those who now lord it over my unhappy
country.”</p>

<p>He spread his hands and eyes in the broadest astonishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Septimius
Misunderstood</div>

<p>“Prince, can it be possible that you have so totally mistaken
me? My perplexities are of an entirely different nature.
The chain with which I am bound is not of roses, but of iron;
a chain of invisible, yet stern influences, that haunt my night,
and even my day.”</p>

<p>His voice faltered, and he turned away with a shudder, as
from a visionary tormentor.</p>

<p>“What? Has that man of desperate arts, if he be man, involved
you, too, in his net? Dares the impostor soar so high?”</p>

<p>He clasped his hands.</p>

<p>“You saw how he defied, how he mocked me, how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
spurned me when my abhorrence rose to the madness of attempting
to strike him. I might as well have flung the
weapon at the clouds. You saw the instinctive terror of my
charger. That animal was celebrated in our whole cavalry for
its bold, nay, fierce courage. Yet before the eye of that man
of power and evil, it cowered like a hare and died of his
glance. By him the temptation has been offered; of its nature
I dare not speak; but it is dazzling, fearful, and must—I feel
it—finally be fatal.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Be a Man—a
Hero”</div>

<p>“Then cast it from you at once. Be a man—a hero.”</p>

<p>“It is hopeless—I must be the victim; I am bound irretrievably.
Farewell, prince; we shall see each other no
more.”</p>

<p>He flung himself upon the couch. I offered him assistance,
advice, consolation in vain. The spirit of the soldier was extinguished.
The victim of fantastic illusion lay before me.
I left him to the care of the old domestics, and when I closed
the door, thought that I had closed the door of the grave.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LV">CHAPTER LV<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Salathiel a Prisoner</i></span></h3>

<p>During this period the city presented the turbulent aspect
that must result from the concourse of vast warlike multitudes,
known only by hereditary bickerings. The clansman of
Judah looked down upon every human being; and his countrymen
among the rest. The Benjamite retorted it, boasted of
the inheritance of Jerusalem, and looked down upon the men
of the Galilees as rioters and plunderers. These, too, had
their objects of scorn, and the remnants of Dan and Ephraim
were held in merciless disdain as the descendants of rebels
and idolaters. To deepen those ancient feuds were thrown in
the mutual injuries of the factions of John and Simon. Their
leaders were now but the shadow of what they had been; yet
the memory of their mischiefs survived with a keenness aggravated
by the public discovery of the insignificance of the
instruments.</p>

<p>Genius in the tyrant offers the consolation that if the chain
has galled us, it has been bound by a hand made for supremacy.
But the last misery of the slave is to have been bound by a
creature even more contemptible than himself; to have given
to folly the homage due to talent; to have stooped before the
base and trembled under the feeble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vanity of
Conquest</div>

<p>The obvious alarm of the enemy, who had now totally withdrawn
from the plain and were occupied with raising rampart
on rampart round their several camps; the triumph over the
unfortunate troop; and the excitement of a crowd of pretended
prophets and frantic visionaries, filled the populace with every
vanity of conquest. The constant exclamation in the streets
was: “Let us march to storm the camps and drive the idolater
into the sea!” But the new luxuries of the city were too
congenial not to act as formidable rivals to the popular ambition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
No leader appeared, the boastings passed away, and
the boiling temperament of the warrior had time to run into
the safer channel of words and wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sabat’s
Wandering</div>

<p>Still one melancholy reminder was there. Through the
wildest festivity, through the groups of drinking, dancing,
bravadoing, and quarreling, Sabat the Ishmaelite moved day
after day, from dawn till evening, pouring out his sentences
of condemnation. Nothing could be more singular or more
awful than his figure as the denouncer of ruin hurried along,
like a being denuded of all objects in life but the one. The
multitude in their most extravagant excesses felt undissembled
fear before him. I have seen the most ferocious tumult
stilled by the sound of his portentous voice; the dagger instantly
sheathed; the head buried in the garment; the form
often prostrate until he passed by. Where he went the song
of license was dumb; the dance ceased; the cup fell from the
hand; and many a lip of violence and blasphemy quivered
with long-forgotten prayer.</p>

<p>How he sustained life none could tell. He was reduced to
a shadow; his eye had the yellow glare of blindness; his once
raven hair was of the whiteness of flax. He was an animated
corpse. But he strode onward with a force which, if few attempted
to resist, none seemed able to withstand; his gestures
were rapid and nervous to an extraordinary degree, and
his voice was overwhelming. It had the rush and volume of
a powerful blast. Even in the clamor of the day, through the
innumerable voices of the streets, it was audible from the remotest
quarters of the city. I heard it through the tread and
shouts of fifty thousand marching men. But in twilight and
silence the eternal “Wo!—wo!—wo!” howled along the
air with a sound that told of nothing human.</p>

<p>His unfortunate bride still followed him, never uttering a
word, never looking but on him. She glided along with him
in his swiftest course, as bound by a spell to wander where
he wandered, an unconscious slave; her form almost a shadow;
without a sound, a gesture, or a glance—her feet alone moved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Presentiment of Wo</div>

<p>I often attempted to render this undone pair some assistance.
Sabat recognized me, and returned brief thanks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
perhaps I was the only man in Jerusalem to whom he vouchsafed
either thanks or memory. But he uniformly refused aid
of every kind, and reproaching himself for the moment given
to human recollections, burst away and again began his denunciation
of “Wo!—wo!—wo!”</p>

<p>The hope of treaty with the besiegers was now nearly
desperate; yet I felt so deeply the ruin that must follow protracted
war that I had labored with incessant anxiety to bring
the people to a sense of their situation. My name was high;
my decided refusal of all command gave me an influence
which threw more grasping ambition into the shade; and the
leading men of Jerusalem were glad to delegate their power
to me, with the double object of relieving themselves from an
effort to which they were unequal, and from a responsibility
under which even their covetousness had begun to tremble.</p>

<p>But Jerusalem was not to be saved;<a name="ENanchor_50" id="ENanchor_50"></a><a href="#Endnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> there was an opposing
fatality—an irresistible, intangible power arrayed
against all efforts. I felt it at my first step. If I had been
treading on a volcano and heard it roar under me, I could not
have been made more sensible of the hollowness and hopelessness
of every effort to save the nation. In the midst of
our most according council some luckless impediment was
sure to start up. While we seemed on the verge of conciliating
and securing the most important interests, to that verge
we were suddenly forbidden all approach. Communications
actually commenced with the Roman general, and which
promised the most certain results, were broken off, none could
tell how. There was an antagonist somewhere, but beyond
our grasp; a hostility as powerful, as constant, and as little
capable of being counteracted as the hostility of the plague.</p>

<p>After my final conversation with Septimius, I had spent the
day in one of those perplexing deliberations, and was returning
with a weary heart when, in an obscure street leading into
the Upper City, I was roused from my reverie by the sound
of one of our mountain songs. Music has been among my
chief solaces through existence, and the song of Naphtali in
that moment of depression keenly moved me. I stopped to
listen in front of the minstrel’s tent, in which a circle of soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and shepherds from the Galilees were sitting over their
cups. His skill deserved a higher audience. He touched his
little harp with elegance to a voice that reminded me of the
sportiveness and wild melody of a bird in spring. The moonlight
shone through the tent, and as the boy sat under its
large white folds in the fantastic dress of his art—a loose
vermilion robe, belted with sparkling stones, and turban of
yellow silk, that drooped upon his shoulder like a golden
pinion—he resembled the Persian pictures of the Peri embosomed
in the bell of the lily. The rude and dark-featured
listeners round him might well have sat for the swart demons
submissive to his will.</p>

<p>But thoughts soon returned that were not to be soothed by
music, and throwing some pieces of money to the boy, I
hastened on. The departure of the young Roman and the influence
that it might have on my family, and peculiarly on
the mind of a creature doubly endeared to me by a strange
and melancholy similitude to the temper of my own excitable
mind, deeply occupied me, and it was even with some presentiment
of evil that I reached home.</p>

<p>The first sound that I heard was the lamentation of the old
domestics. But I could not wait to solve their unintelligible
attempts to explain the disaster. I flew to my family.
Miriam was absorbed in profound sorrow; Salome was in loud
affliction. Dreading everything that could be told me, yet
with that sullen hardihood which long misfortune gives, I
took my wife’s hands and in a voice struggling for composure
desired her to tell me the worst at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Esther is
Gone!”</div>

<p>“Esther is gone!” was her answer.</p>

<p>She could articulate no more; the effort to speak this shook
her whole frame. But Salome broke out into loud reprobation
of the baseness of the wretch who had turned our hospitality
into a snare, and whose life, twice saved, was employed only
to bring misery on his preserver.</p>

<p>The blow fell upon me with the keenness of a sword.</p>

<p>“Was Esther, was my daughter, my innocent, darling
Esther, consenting to this flight?”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said Miriam. “I dare not ask myself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
question. If she can have forgotten her duty to follow the
stranger; if she can have left her parents—no. It must have
been through some horrid artifice. But the thought is too
bitter. Raise no more such thoughts in my mind.”</p>

<p>She sank in silence. But Salome was not to be restrained.
She asserted the total impossibility of Esther’s having thrown
off her allegiance to religion and filial duty.</p>

<p>“She must have been,” said this generous and enthusiastic
being, “either subjected to those dreadful arts in which the
idolaters deal, or carried away by force. Constantius has gone
already in search of her; feeble as he is, he determined to
discover the robber, and tho his steps were weak and the
effort may hazard his life, he would not be restrained, nor
would I restrain him where I should have so much rejoiced to
hazard my own.”</p>

<p>I rose to depart. Miriam clung to me.</p>

<p>“Must I lose all, Salathiel?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Goes
to the Rescue</div>

<p>“I am the guilty one, wife! I should have guarded against
this. I alone am to blame. I will recover Esther. Without
her we all should be miserable. The Roman general is just.
I will demand her of Septimius in his presence. Miriam!
you shall see your child. Salome! you shall see your sister.
And now, come to my heart—come both; my last hope of
happiness, the remnant of all that once promised to fill my
declining days with peace and prosperity. Weep no more,
Miriam, Salome! I must not be unmanned at this time of
trial. Go to your chambers and pray for me. Farewell!”</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight and the city sounds were hushed,
except where the crowds, which still poured in, struggled for
their quarters. The very fear of being thus disturbed kept up
the disturbance of the population, and in the leading avenues
the tents showed fierce watchers against this violence sitting
round their tables, until wine either sent them to sleep or
roused them into daggers-drawing. Subordination was now
at an end; plunder and blood were to be dreaded by every
man who ventured among those champions of freedom and
property; and more than once this night I was compelled to
show that I wore a weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the disorder which left the city a seat of dissolute riot
was not suffered to interfere with its actual defense. That
singular mixture of rabble giddiness and sacred care which
distinguished my countrymen above all nations was fully displayed
in those final hours, and the walls that enclosed a
million of rioters and robbers were guarded with the solemn
vigilance of a sanctuary.</p>

<p>No argument could prevail with the peasantry at the gates
to let me pass. My rank, and even my public name, went for
little in the scale against the possibility of my renewing the
treaty with an enemy whom they now scorned, and I was
doubting whether I must not lose the night by the reluctance
of those rough but honest sentinels, when I was cheered by
seeing one of the head men of their tribe arrive. He had been
a furious partizan; honor and honesty were his declared worship,
and his horror of humbler motives was fierceness itself.
This was enough for me. I knew what public vehemence
means. I took him aside, without ceremony put gold into his
grasp, and saw the gate thrown open before me by the immaculate
hand of the patriotic Jonathan.</p>

<p>While I had scarcely congratulated myself on having
passed this formidable barrier and was still within the defenses,
the trampling of horse echoed on the road. The night
was clear, and there was no hope of avoiding them. A large
body of Idumean horsemen came on, escorting wagons of provision.
The foremost riders were half asleep, and I was in
strong hope of eluding them all when one of the drivers, in
the wantonness of authority, laid his whip on me. I rashly
returned the blow, and the man fell off his horse. I was surrounded,
charged with murder; was brought before their
chieftain, and found that chieftain Onias!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Old
Enemy</div>

<p>My old enemy recognized me instantly, and with undying
revenge firing every feature demanded whither I was going.</p>

<p>“To the Roman camp,” was the direct answer.</p>

<p>“The purpose?”</p>

<p>“To have an interview with the Roman general.”</p>

<p>“You come deputed by the authorities?”</p>

<p>“By not one of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Right of
the Stronger</div>

<p>“I long ago knew you to be a daring fellow, but you exceed
my opinion. We can not spare heroes from Jerusalem at
this time; you must turn back with us.”</p>

<p>“By what right?”</p>

<p>“By the right of the stronger.”</p>

<p>“With what object?”</p>

<p>“That you may be hanged as a deserter. It will save you
the trouble of going to Titus, to be hanged as a spy.”</p>

<p>I disdained reply, and in the midst of a circle of barbarians
exulting over their capture, as if they had taken the chief
enemy of the state, was marched back to the walls.</p>

<p>There I was not the only person disturbed by the adventure.
The first glimpse of me caught by Jonathan exhibited
everything that could be ludicrous in the shape of consternation.
To the inquiries how I was suffered to pass he answered
by an appeal to his “honor,” which he again valued, in my
presence too, “as the most invaluable possession of the citizen
soldier.” He said the words without a blush, and I even
listened to them without a smile. He probably trembled a
little for his bribe; but he soon discovered by my look that I
considered the money as too far gone to be worth pursuing.</p>

<p>Yet Onias, who seemed to know him as well as I, fixed on
him a scrutinizing aspect, of all others the most hateful to a
delicate conscience, and his only resource was to heap opprobrium
upon me.</p>

<p>“How I had contrived to escape the guard,” said Jonathan,
“was totally inconceivable, unless it was by”—I gave him an
assuring glance—“by imposing on the credulity of some of
the ignorant peasants; possibly even by direct corruption.
But to put the matter out of future possibility he would proceed
to examine the prisoner’s person.”</p>

<p>He proceeded accordingly, and from my sash took my
purse, as a public precaution. He was a vigilant guardian of
the state, for the purse was never restored.</p>

<p>Onias looked at him during his harangue with a countenance
between contempt and ridicule.</p>

<p>“I must go forward now,” said he; “but, captain, see to
your prisoner. He must answer before the council to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
and as you have so worthily disabled him from operations
with the guard, your own head is answerable for his
safe-keeping.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Confined in a
Tower</div>

<p>My enemy, to make all sure, himself saw me lodged within
the tower over the gate, comforted his soul by a parting
promise that my time was come, and rode off with his Idumeans—to
the boundless satisfaction of the scrupulous and
much-alarmed Jonathan.</p>

<p>The tower was massive, and there was no probability that
anything less than a Roman battering-ram would ever lay
open its solid sides. The captain had recovered his virtue at
the instant of my losing my purse, and I now could no more
dream of sapping his integrity than of sapping the huge
blocks of the tower. Whether I was to be prisoner for the
night, or for the siege, or to glut the ax by morning, were
questions which lay in the bosom of as implacable a villain
as long-delayed revenge ever made malignant; but what was
to become of my child, of my family, of my share in the
great cause, for which alone life was of value?</p>

<p>The chamber to which I was consigned was at the top of
the tower and overlooked a vast extent of country. Before me
were the Roman camps, seen clearly in the moonlight, and
wrapt in silence, except when the solitary trumpet sounded
the watch, or the heavy tread of a troop going its rounds was
heard. The city sounds were but the murmurs of the sinking
tide of the multitude. The spring was in her glory. The air
came fresh and sweet from the fields. All was tranquillity;
yet what a mass of destructive power was lying motionless
under that tranquillity! Fire, sword, and man were before
me—elements of evil that a touch could rouse into tempest,
not to be allayed but by torrents of blood and the ruin of
empires.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>A Narrow Escape</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A Basket of
Wine</div>

<p>While my mind was wandering away in thoughts of the
madness of ambition in so brief a being as man, I heard a loud
clamor of voices in the chambers below. The rustic guards
had been enjoying themselves, but their wine was already
out, and they set their faces boldly against the discipline
which pretended to limit the wine of patriots so true and
thirsty. The clamor arose from the discovery that the cellars
of the tower had been examined by a previous guard, who
provided for the temperance of their successors by taking the
whole temptation to themselves. High words followed between
the abettors of discipline and the partizans of the
vintage, and if my door were but unbarred I might have expeditiously
relieved the captain of his charge. But its bolts
were enormous, and I tried them in vain. As I was giving
up the effort, a light footstep ascended the stairs; a key turned
in the ponderous wards, and the minstrel of the tent stood before
me.</p>

<p>“If you wish to escape from certain death,” he whispered,
“do as I bid you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Minstrel’s Aid</div>

<p>He looked from the casement, sang a few notes, and on
being answered from without pulled up a rope, which we
hauled in together. The task was of some difficulty, but at
length a weighty basket appeared, loaded with wine. He
took a portion of the contraband freight in his hands and
without a word disappeared. I heard his welcome proclaimed
below with loud applause. Half the guard were instantly on
the stairs to assist him down with the remainder, but against
this he firmly protested, and threatened in case of a single
attempt to interfere with his operations that he would awake
the captain and publicly give back this incomparable private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
store to the legitimate hand. The threat was effective; the
unlading of the basket was left to his own dexterity, and at
length but one solitary flask lay before us.</p>

<p>“You deserve some payment for your trouble,” said he,
with the careless and jovial air of his brethren. “Here’s to
your night’s enterprise, whatever it be,” pouring out a few
drops and tasting them, while he gave a large draft to my
feverish lips. “And now, good-night, my prince, unless you
love the tower too much to take leave of this gallant guard
by a window.”</p>

<p>“But, boy, if you should be detected in assisting my
escape?”</p>

<p>“I have no fear of that,” said he. “I have been detected
in all sorts of frolics in my time, and yet here I am. The
truth is, my prince, I have traveled in your country and have
an old honor for your name. No later than to-day you gave
me the handsomest present I have got since I came within the
walls. I know the noble captain of the guard to be a thorough
knave, and the mighty Onias to want nothing for wickedness
but the opportunity. In short, the thought occurred to me,
on seeing you, to help the honest revelers below to a little
more wine than was good for their understandings, the contraband
being a commodity in which, between ourselves, I
deal; and further to break the laws by assisting you to leave
captain, sentinels, and all behind.”</p>

<p>I asked what was to be done.</p>

<p>“If you value your life, be the substitute for the empty
flasks and make your way through the air like a bird. I shall
be safe enough. You need have no fears for me.”</p>

<p>I coiled the rope round a beam, forced myself through the
narrow casement, and launched out into air at a height of a
hundred feet. If I felt any distrust, it was brief. I was
rapidly lowered, passing the various casements, in which I
saw the successive watches of the guard drinking, sleeping,
singing, and discussing public affairs with village rationality.
Luckily no eye turned upon the fugitive, and the ground was
touched at last.</p>

<p>In another moment the minstrel came, rather flying than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
sliding, down the rope. I said something in acknowledgment
of this service, but he laid his finger on his lip, and pointing
to a rampart, where a moving torch showed me that we were
still within observation, led on through paths beset with
thickets that no eye could penetrate, but, as he laughingly
said, “that of a supplier of garrisons with contraband.” But
their intricacy offered no obstruction to this stripling; and
after amusing himself with my perplexities he led me to the
verge of the plain.</p>

<p>“I have detained you,” said he, “in these brambles for the
double purpose of avoiding the lookout from the battlements
and of giving the moon time to hide her blushing beauties.”</p>

<p>She lay reddening with the mists on the horizon.</p>

<p>“She has been often called our mother, and as her children
the minstrels are allowed the privilege of keeping later hours
and being madder than the mob of mankind. But like other
children we are sometimes engaged in matters which would
dispense with the maternal eye, and to-night I wished that
she was many a fathom below the ocean. Mother,” said he,
throwing himself into an attitude, “take a child’s blessing
and begone.”</p>

<p>The words were spoken to a touch on his little harp—rambling,
but singularly sweet.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said he with a sigh, as he turned and
saw me gazing in admiration of his skill, “I am weary to
death of my profession.”</p>

<p>“Then why not leave it? You are fit for better things.
Your skill is of the very nature that makes its way in the
world.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Freedom
of Singing</div>

<p>“Why not leave it? For a hundred reasons. In the first
place, I should be more wearied of every other. I should be
the bird in the cage, fed, sheltered, and possibly a favorite.
But what bird would not rather take the chance of the open
air, even to be scorched by the summer and frozen by the
winter? No; let me clap my pinions and sing my song under
the free canopy of the skies, or be voiceless, and wingless,
and—dead.”</p>

<p>“Boy, this is the natural language of your years. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
time must come when the spirit sinks and man requires other
charms in life than the power of roaming.”</p>

<p>He hung his head over the harp and let his fingers stray
among the strings. The moon was now touching the mountains.</p>

<p>“We must begone,” said I. “I owe you something for
your night’s service, which shall be repaid by taking you
into my household should the siege be raised; if not, you are
but as you were.”</p>

<p>He was all nervous excitement at the offer—wept, laughed,
danced, played a prelude upon the strings, kissed my hand,
and finally bounded away before me. I called to him, repeating
my wish that he should go no farther.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Minstrel
Guide</div>

<p>“Impossible,” said he; “you would be lost in a moment.
If I had not crossed the ground hundreds of times, I should
never be able to find my road. Half a mile forward it is all
rampart, trench, and ravine. You would be stopped by a
myriad of sentinels. Nothing on earth could get to the foot
of yonder hills, but an army—or a minstrel.”</p>

<p>He ran on before me, and ran with a rapidity that tasked
even my foot to follow. We soon came into the fortified
ground, and I then felt his value. He led me over fosse and
rampart, up the scarp and through the palisade, with the
sagacity of instinct. But this was not all. I repeatedly saw
the sentinels within a few feet of us, and expected to be
challenged every moment, but not a syllable was heard. I
passed with patrols of the legionary horse on either side of
me; still not a word. I walked through the rows of tents, in
which the troops were preparing for the duties of the morning.
Not an eye fell upon me, and I almost began to believe myself,
like a hero of the heathen fables, covered with a cloud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s New Captors</div>

<p>The boy still continued racing along, until, on reaching the
summit of a mound at some distance in front of me, he uttered
a cry and fell. I had heard no challenge, and hurried toward
him. A flight of arrows whizzed over my head, and the black
visages of a mob of Ethiopian riders<a name="ENanchor_51" id="ENanchor_51"></a><a href="#Endnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> came bounding up a
hollow between us. It was not my purpose to fight, even if I
had any hope of success against marksmen who could hit an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
elephant’s eye. I surrendered in every language of which I
was capable. But the Ethiopians only shook their woolly
heads, laid hands on me, and began an investigation of my
riches creditable to polished society. Barbarians, with a
tongue and physiognomy worthy only of their kindred baboons,
probed every plait of my garments, with an accuracy
that could have been surpassed only in the most civilized
custom-houses of the empire. A succession of shrieks, which
I mistook for rage, but which were the mirth of those sons of
darkness, were the prelude to measures which augured more
formidable consequences. A rope was thrown over my arms,
and I was led toward the outposts.</p>

<p>Yet even the neighborhood of their Roman friends did not
seem the most congenial to my captors. More than one consultation
was held, in which their white teeth were bared to
the jaw with rage, and their simitars were whirled like so
many flashes of lightning about each other’s turbans, before
they could decide whether my throat was to be cut on the
spot, to get rid of an incumbrance, or whether they were to
try how far the emptiness of my purse might not be made up
by the reward for the capture of a spy in the trappings of a
chieftain.</p>

<p>I gave up remonstrance where, if I had all the tongues of
Babel, none of them seemed likely to answer my purpose, and
reserving the nice distinction between an ambassador and a
spy for more cultivated ears, quietly walked onward in the
midst of this troop of thieves; the more insensible to honesty
or argument, as they were privileged according to law. But
our approach to the camp bred another difficulty. The troop
felt an obvious disinclination to come too close to the legionaries.
Untutored as the negroes were, they had acquired a
knowledge of the official conscience, and they bowed to the
mastery of the white in plunder as among the accomplishments
of an advanced age!</p>

<p>All could not venture to the camp; yet who was to be entrusted
with receiving the reward? The discussion was carried
on chiefly by gesture, which sometimes proceeded to
blows, and at last was wound up to such vigor that a brawny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
ruffian, to preserve the peace, seized the rope and, dragging
me out the circle, began sharpening his simitar, to extinguish
the controversy. But at the instant a horrid outcry arose, and
a figure, hideous beyond conception, not a foot high, blacker
than the blackest, and darting flames from its mouth, bounded
in among us, mounted upon a wild beast of a horse that
kicked and tore at everything. The Ethiopians shrieked with
terror and scattered on all sides at the first shock, but the
ground was so cut up by the military operations that they
stumbled at every step. Some were unhorsed; some probably
had their necks broken, and others carried home the tale, to
spread it through the land of lions. I heard it long after, exciting
the utmost amaze in a venerable circle round one of
the fountains of the Nile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Appeal</div>

<p>I was now saved from being thus summarily made the
victim of peace, but was as far as ever from freedom. While
I was endeavoring to loose the rope, a patrol of the legionary
horse came galloping from the camp, and I was seized with
this badge of a bad character upon me. But the flying negroes
were the more amusing objects. There was just light enough
to see them rolling about the plain; turbans flying off in the
air; and the few riders who could boast of keeping their
seats, whirled away over brake and brier, at the mercy of
their frightened horses. This display, which had been at first
taken for the prelude to an assault on the lines, was now a
source of pleasantry, and the horsemanship of the savages
was honored with many a roar.</p>

<p>My case came next under consideration. “I was found at
the edge of the Roman entrenchments, where to be found was
to die; I was besides taken with the mark of reprobation
upon me.”</p>

<p>I pleaded my own merits loudly, and appealed to the rope
as evidence that I was not there by my own will. The legionaries
were better soldiers than logicians, and my defense perplexed
them until some one thought of inquiring what brought
me there at all. The troop flocked round to hear my answer
to this overwhelming question. I told my purpose in a few
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">On the Point
of Death</div>

<p>The scale again turned in my favor, and I began to think
victory secure, when a young standard-bearer, who was probably
destined to rise in the state, declared, with a splenetic
tongue and brow of office, that “in this land of cheating too
much precaution could not be adopted against cheats of all
colors; that the more plausible my story was, the more likely
it was to be a falsehood; and finally, that as my escape might
do some kind of mischief, while my hanging could do none
whatever, it was advisable to hang me without delay.”</p>

<p>The orator spoke the words of popularity, and my fate was
sealed. But a new difficulty arose. By whom was the sentence
to be put in execution?—for the duty would have sullied
the legionary honor for life. A trampled African, who lay
groaning in a ditch beside me, caught the sound of the debate,
dragged himself out, and offered, mangled as he was, to perform
the office for any sum that their generosity might think
proper to give. Never was man nearer to paying the grand
debt than I was at that moment. The African recovered his
vigor as by magic, and the young statesman took upon himself
the superintendence of this service to his country. I
raised my voice loudly against this violence to a “negotiator”;
but the troopers of the imperial horse had been roused from
their sleep on my account, and they were not to return, liable
to the ridicule of having been roused by a false alarm. I still
endeavored to put off the evil hour, when the trampling of a
large body of cavalry was heard.</p>

<p>“The general!” exclaimed the young officer, who evidently
had an instinctive sensibility to the approach of rank.</p>

<p>“Let Titus come,” said I, “or any man of honor, and <em>he</em>
will understand me.”</p>

<p>I tore the badge of disgrace from my arms and stepped forward
to meet the great son of Vespasian. My confidence
alarmed the troop, and the standard-bearer made way for the
man who dared to speak to the heir of the throne. But the
general was not Titus; a broad, brutal countenance, red with
excess, glared haughtily round. I recognized Cestius. A
whisper from one of the officers put him in possession of the
circumstances, and he rode up to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>“So, rebel! you are come to this at last! You have been
taken in the fact and must undergo your natural fate.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Defies Cestius</div>

<p>“I demand to be led to your general. I scorn to defend
myself before inferiors.”</p>

<p>“Inferiors!” He bit his livid lip. “Traitor, you are not
now on the hill of Scopas at the head of an army.”</p>

<p>“Nor you,” said I, “on the plain at the head of an army—and
so much the more fortunate for both you and them. But
I scorn to talk to men whose backs I have seen. Lead me to
your master, fugitive!”</p>

<p>The troops, unaccustomed to this plain speaking, looked
on with wonder. Cestius himself was staggered, but the nature
of the man soon returned, and in a voice of fury he
ordered a body of Arab archers, who were seen moving at a
distance, to be brought up for the extinction of a “traitor unworthy
of a Roman sword.” The Arabs, exhilarated by the
prospect of employment, came up, shouting, tossing their
lances, and shooting their arrows. As a last resource, I solemnly
protested against this murder, which I pronounced to
be the work of a revenge disgraceful to the name of soldier;
and taunting Cestius with his defeat, demanded that, if he
doubted my honor, he should try on the spot “which of our
swords was the better.”</p>

<p>He answered only by a glare of rage and a gesture to the
archers, who instantly threw themselves into a half circle
round me, with the expertness of proficients in the trade of
justice, and bended their bows. Determined to resist to the
last, I flung out upbraidings and scorn upon the murderer,
which drove him to hide his head behind the troops. Another
disturbance arose. Simitars waved, turbans shook, horses
plunged; the deep order was broken, and at length a horseman,
magnificently appareled and mounted, burst into the
ring and looked fiercely round.</p>

<p>“What, you miscreants,” he shouted, “who dares to take
command out of my hands? Down with your bows! Commit
murder and I not present! The first man that pulls a string
shall leave an empty saddle. Draw off, cutthroats, or if you
want to do the world a service, shoot one another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Meeting
With the
Captain</div>

<p>I seemed to remember the voice, but I gazed in vain on the
splendid figure. The turban that, blazing with gems, hung
down on his forehead, and the beard that, black as the
raven’s wing, curled full round his lip, completely baffled me.
He looked at me in turn, thrust out a sinewy hand, and,
clasping mine, exclaimed with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Prince, does the plumage make you forget the bird? What
can have brought you into the hands of my culprits? I
thought that you were drowned, burned, or a candidate for
the imperial diadem by this time.”</p>

<p>I now knew him.</p>

<p>“My friend of the free-trade!” said I in a low tone.</p>

<p>He spoke in a fearless tone. “By no means. I have reformed—am
a changed man—captain of the seas no more;
but a loyal plunderer—in the service of Vespasian, and in
command of a thousand Arab cavalry that will ride, run
away, and rob with any corps in the service; and the word is
a bold one.”</p>

<p>Our brief conference was broken up by the return of Cestius,
who, outrageous at the delay and coming to inquire the
cause, found fresh fuel for his wrath in the sight of the Arab
captain turned into my protector. With an execration he demanded
“why his orders had been disobeyed.”</p>

<p>The captain answered, with the most provoking coolness,
that “no Roman officer, let his rank be what it might, was
entitled to degrade the allies into executioners.”</p>

<p>The Roman grew furious with the slight in the face of the
troops, who highly enjoyed it. The Arab grew more sarcastic,
till Cestius was rash enough to lift his hand, and the Arab
anticipated the blow, by dashing his charger at him and leaving
the general and his horse struggling together on the
ground. An insult of this kind to the second in command
was, of course, not to be forgiven. The Arabs bent their bows
to make battle for their captain, but he forbade resistance;
and when the legionary tribune demanded his sword, he surrendered
it with a smile, saying that “he had done service
enough for one day in saving an honest man and punishing a
ruffian,” and that he should justify himself to Titus alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Approach
of the Enemy</div>

<p>My fate was still undetermined. But the legionaries soon
had more pressing matters to think of. The clangor of horns
and shouts came in the direction of the city. The plain still
lay in shade, but I could see through the dusk immense crowds
moving forward like an inundation. The legions were instantly
under arms, and I stood a chance of being walked
over by two armies!</p>

<p>But I was not to encounter so distinguished a catastrophe.
Some symptoms of my inclination to escape attracted the eye
of the guard, and I was marched to the common repository of
malefactors in the rear of the lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Within Sound
of Battle</div>

<p>My new quarters were within the walls of one of those
huge country mansions which the pride of our ancestors had
built to be the plague of their posterity; for those the enemy
chiefly employed for our prisons. Their solid strength defied
desultory attack; time made little other impression on them
than to picture their walls with innumerable stains; and the
man must be a practised prison-breaker who could force his
way out of their depths of marble. But if my eyes were useless,
my ears had their full indulgence. Every sound of the
conflict was heard. The attack was furious, and must have
often been close to the walls of my dungeon. The various
rallying-cries of the tribes rang through its halls; then a
Roman shout, and the heavy charge of the cavalry would
roll along until, after an encountering roar and a long clashing
of weapons, the tumult passed away, to be rapidly renewed
by the obstinate bravery of my unfortunate countrymen.</p>

<p>I felt as a man and a leader must feel during scenes in
which he ought to take a part, yet to which he is virtually
as dead as the sleeper in the tomb. My life had been activity;
my heart was in the cause; I had knowledge, zeal, and
strength that might in the chances of battle turn the scale. I
even often heard my name among the charging cries of the
day. But here I lay within impassable barriers. A thousand
times during those miserable hours I measured their height
with my eye; then threw myself on the ground, and placing
my hands over my ears, labored to exclude thought from my
soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sons of Chance</div>

<p>But my fellow prisoners were practical philosophers to a
man; untaught in the schools, ’tis true, yet fully trained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
that great academy worth all that Philosophy ever dreamed
in—experience. In all my wanderings among mankind I
never before had so ample an opportunity of studying variety
of character. War is the hotbed that urges all our qualities,
good and evil, into their broadest luxuriance. The generous
become munificent; the mean darken into the villainous; and
the rude harden into brutality. The camp is the great inn at
which all the dubious qualities set up their rest, and a single
campaign perfects the culprit to the height of his profession.
There were round me in these immense halls about five hundred
profligates, any one of whose histories would have been
invaluable to a scorner of human nature.</p>

<p>Among the loose armies of the East those fellows exercised
their vocation as regular appendages; often lived in luxury,
and sometimes shot up into leaders themselves. But robbery
in the Roman armies required master-hands. The temptation
was strong, for the legionary was the grand ravager, and like
the lion, he left the larger share of the prey to the jackal.
Yet justice, inexorable and rapid, was his rule—in all cases
but his own; and the jackal, suspected of trespassing within
the legitimate distance from the superior savage, ran imminent
hazard of being disqualified for all encroachment to
come. Three-fourths of my associates had played this perilous
game, and its penalties were now awaiting only the first
leisure of the troops. Peace, at all times vexatious to their
trade, had thus a double disgust for them, and the most patriotic
son of Israel could not have taken a more zealous interest
in the defeat of the legions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Victim of Ingratitude</div>

<p>But philosophy still predominated; if hope was at an end,
hilarity took its place, and the prison rang with reckless exhibitions
of practical glee, riotous songs, and mockeries. In
the idleness of the lingering hours the professional talents of
those sons of chance were brought into play. The mimic collected
his audience, burlesqued the pompous officials of the
army, and gathered his pence and plaudits as if he were under
the open sky and could call his head his own. The nostrum-vender
had his secrets for the cure of every ill, and
harangued on the impotence of brand, scourge, and blade, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
the patient had but the wisdom to employ his irresistible
unguent. The soothsayer sold fate at the lowest price, and
fixed the casualties of the next four-and-twenty hours—an
easy task with the principal part of his audience. The minstrel
chanted the pleasures of a life unencumbered by care
or conscience; and the pilferer, with but an hour to live, exercised
his trade with an industry proportioned to the shortness
of his time.</p>

<p>In the whole gang I met with but one man thoroughly out
of spirits. He had obviously been no favorite of fortune, for
the human form could scarcely be less indebted to clothing.
His swarthy visage was doubly blackened by hunger and exhaustion,
and even his voice had a prison sound. Driven away
from the joyous groups by the natural repulsion which the
careless feel at visages that remind them of trouble, he took
refuge in the corner where I lay, tormented by every echo of
the battle. Not unwilling to forget the melancholy scenes in
which every moment was draining the last blood of my country,
I turned to the wretch beside me and asked the cause of
his sorrows.</p>

<p>“Ingratitude,” was the reply. “This is a villainous world;
a man may spend his life in serving others, and what will he
gain in the end? Nothing. There is, for instance, the prince
of Damascus wallowing in wealth; yet the greatest rogue
under this roof has not a more pitiful stock of honor. Witness
his conduct to me. He was out of favor with his uncle,
the late prince; was not worth more than the raiment on his
limbs, and as likely to finish his days on the gibbet as any
of the knot of robbers that helped him to scour the roads
about Sidon. In his distress he applied to me. I had driven
a handsome share of the free-trade between Egypt and the
north, and now and then gave him a handsome price for his
booty. The idea of bringing his uncle to terms was out of the
question. I named my price; it was allowed to be fair. I
made my way into the palace, was exalted to the honors of
cupbearer, and on my first night of office gave the old man a
cup which cured him of drunkenness forever. And what do
you think was my reward?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Interest
Roused</div>

<p>“I could name what it ought to have been.”</p>

<p>“You conclude half the old man’s jewels at the least. No;
not a stone—not a shekel. I was thrown into chains, and
finally kicked out of the city, with a promise, the only one
that he will ever keep, that if I venture there again I shall
leave it without my head! There’s gratitude! There’s honor
for you!</p>

<p>“My next example,” he continued, “was among the Romans.
It must be owned that they pay well for secret services. But
then, ingratitude infects them from top to toe. I had been
three years in their employment, and if I made free with a
few of their secrets in favor of others, it was only on the commercial
principle of having as many customers as one can
supply; still, I helped them to the knowledge of all that was
going on.”</p>

<p>He had found a listener, and indulged his recollection;
after a variety of events, in which he cheated everybody, he
came to one that had some interest for myself.</p>

<p>“At last a showy adventurer changed the scene,” he continued.
“Some insult had stirred up his blood, and in revenge
he sailed away with the prefect’s galley and set up on his
own account. Not a sail, from a shallop to a trireme, could
touch the water from the Cyclades to Cyprus without being
overhauled by the captain. I was set by the prefect upon his
track, and got into his good graces by lending him a little of
my information, of which he made such desperate use that
the Roman swore my destruction as a traitor. To make up
the quarrel I tried a wider game, and was bringing his fleet
upon the pirates in their very nest when ill luck came across
me. A pair whom to the last hour of my life nothing will
persuade me to think anything but demons, sent expressly to
do me mischief, spoiled one of the finest inventions that ever
came into the head of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Becomes a Foil</div>

<p>“The consequence was that the pirates, instead of being attacked,
burned the Roman’s trireme round him, and would
have burned himself, if he had not thought a watery end
better than a fiery one, leaped overboard, and gone straight to
the bottom. The whole blame fell upon me, and my only payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
was the cropping of my ears and a declaration, sworn to
in the names of Romulus and Remus, that if I ever ventured
again within a Roman camp I should not get off so well. Ingratitude
again! Never was a man so unfortunate.”</p>

<p>“Quite the contrary. It appears to me that seldom was
man so lucky. If one in a hundred would have your tale to
tell, not one in a thousand would have lived to tell it.” I had
already recognized the Egyptian of the cavern.</p>

<p>“But justice, honor!”</p>

<p>“Say no more about them. Whatever the Romans may be
in the matter of justice, your case is an answer to all charges
on their mercy.”</p>

<p>He looked at me with a ghastly grimace, and as he threw
back the long and squalid locks that covered his countenance,
showed what beggary had done to the sleek features of the
once superbly clothed and jeweled sea-rover.</p>

<p>“But what,” said I, “threw a man of your virtue among
such a gang of caitiffs as are here?”</p>

<p>“Another instance of ingratitude. I had been for twenty
years connected with one of the leading men of Jerusalem,
and I will say that in my experience of mankind I have
known no individual less perplexed with weakness of conscience.
He had a difficult game to play between the Romans,
whom he served privately, the Jews, whom he served publicly,
and himself, whom he served with at least as much zeal
as either of his employers. The times were made for the success
of a man who has his eyes open and suffers neither the
fear of anything on earth nor the hope of anything after it
to shut them. He succeeded accordingly; got rid of some
rivals by the dagger; sent others to the dungeon; bribed
where money would answer his purpose; threatened where
threats would be current coin; and by the practise of those
natural means of rising in public affairs, became the hope of
a faction. But on his glory there was one cloud—the prince
of Naphtali!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Onias and His Rival</div>

<p>I listened attentively. I had deeply known the early hostility
of Onias, but his devices were too tortuous for me to
trace, and until the past night I had lost sight of him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
years. I asked what cause of bitterness existed between
those personages.</p>

<p>“A hundred, as generally happens where the imagination
becomes a party and the accuser is the judge. The prince in
his youth and before he attained his rank had the insolence to
fall in love with the woman marked by Onias for his own.
He had the additional insolence to win her; and the completion
of his crimes was marriage. Onias thenceforth swore his
ruin. Public convulsions put off the promise, and while he
was driven to his last struggle to keep himself among the
living, he had the angry indulgence of seeing the young husband
shoot up without any trouble into rank, wealth, and renown.”</p>

<p>“But has not time blunted his hostility?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Time, as the proverb goes, blunts nothing but a man’s
wit, his teeth, and his good intentions,” said the knave, with
a sneer on his grim visage. “The next half of the proverb is
that it sharpens wine, women, and wickedness. What Onias
may have been doing of late I can only guess; but unless he
is changed by miracle, he has been dealing in every villainous
contrivance from subornation to sorcery. I had my own
affairs to mind. But unless Satan owes him a grudge, he is
now not far from his revenge.”</p>

<p>I thought of our meeting at the city gates, and alarmed at
the chance of his discovering my family, anxiously asked
whether Onias had obtained any late knowledge of his rival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Confessor’s Fear</div>

<p>“Of that I know but little,” said he; “yet quick as his revenge
may be, unless my honest employer manages with more
temper than usual, he will rue the hour when he set foot on
the track of the prince of Naphtali. If ever man possessed
the mastery of the spirits that our wizards pretend to raise,
the prince is that man. I myself have hunted him for years,
yet he always baffled me. I have laid traps for him that
nothing in human cunning could have escaped, yet he broke
through them as if they were spider’s webs. I saw him sent
to the thirstiest lover of blood that ever sat on a throne. Yet
he came back, aye, from the very clutch of Nero. I maddened
his friends against him, and he contrived to escape even from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
the malice of his friends, a matter which you will own is
among the most memorable. I had him plunged into a dungeon,
where I kept him alive for certain reasons, while Onias
was to be kept to his bargain by the prisoner’s reappearance.
Yet he escaped, and my last intelligence of him is that he
is at this moment living in pomp in Jerusalem, the spot where
I have been for the last month in close pursuit of him. Time
or some marvelous power must have disguised him. And yet
if I were to meet him this night——”</p>

<p>“Look on me, slave!” I exclaimed, and grasping him by
the throat unsheathed my dagger. “You have found him,
and to your cost. Villain! it is to you then that I owe so
much misery. Make your peace with Heaven if you can,
for it would be a crime to suffer you to leave this spot
alive.”</p>

<p>He was dumb with terror. I held him with an iron grasp.
The thought that if he escaped me, it must be only to let loose
a murderer against my house, made me feel his death an act
of justice.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” he at last muttered; “let me live; I am not
fit to die. In the name of that Lord whom you worship, spare
me!” He fell at my feet in desperate supplication. “You
have not heard all; I have abjured your enemy. Spare me and
I will swear to pass my days in the desert, never to come
again before the face of man; to lie upon the rock, to live
upon the weed, to drink of the pool until I sink into the
grave!”</p>

<p>I paused in disgust at the abject eagerness for life in a
wretch self-condemned! While I held the dagger before him,
his senses continued bound up by fear. He gazed on it with
an eye that quivered with every quivering of the steel. With
one hand he grasped my uplifted arm as he knelt, and with
the other gathered his rags round his throat to cover it from
the blow. His voice was lost in horrid gaspings; his mouth
was wide open and livid. I sheathed the weapon, and his
countenance instantly returned into its old grimace. A
ghastly smile grew upon it as he now drew from his bosom a
small packet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Hold upon
Onias</div>

<p>“If you had put me to death,” said the wretch, “you would
have lost your best friend. This packet contains a correspondence
for which Onias would give all that he is worth in the
world; and well he might, for the man who has it in his
hands has his life. The world is made up of ingratitude.
After all my services—slandering here, plundering there,
hunting down his opponents in every direction, till they either
put themselves out of the world or he saved them the trouble—he
had the baseness to throw me off. At the head of his
troops he kicked me from his horse’s side, ordering me to be
turned loose, ‘to carry my treachery to the Romans, if they
should be fools enough to think me worth the hire.’ I took
him at his word. I was watching my opportunity to enter
Jerusalem and stab him to the heart when I was taken by
some of the plunderers that hover round the camp, and am
now probably to suffer for the benefit of Roman morality, as
a robber and assassin, as soon as the legions shall have murdered
every man and robbed every mansion in Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>The packet contained a correspondence of Onias with the
Romans. A sensation of triumph glowed through me—I held
the fate of my implacable enemy in my hand. I could now,
with a word, strike to the earth the being whose artifices and
cruelties had waylaid me through life, and the traitor to my
country would perish by the same blow that avenged my own
wrongs. My nature was made for passion. In love and hatred,
in ambition, in revenge, my original spirit knew no bounds.
Time, sorrow, and the conviction of my own outcast state had
partially softened those hazardous impulses, and I found the
value of adversity. Misfortune comes with healing on its
wings to the burning temper of the heart, as the tempest
comes to the arid soil; it tears up the surface, but softens it
for the seeds of the nobler virtues; even in its feeblest work,
it cools the withering and devouring heat for a time. I had
yet to find with what fatal rapidity the heart gives way to its
old overwhelming temptations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Power of Gold</div>

<p>“I spare your life,” said I, “but on one condition—that
you henceforth make Onias the constant object of your vigilance;
that you keep him from all injury to me and mine; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
that when I shall seize him at last, you shall be forthcoming
to give public proof of his treachery.”</p>

<p>“This sounds well,” said the Egyptian as he cast his eyes
round the lofty hall, “but it would sound better if we were
not on this side of the gate. All the talking in the world will
not sink these walls an inch, nor make that gate turn on its
hinges, tho for that, and for every other too, there is one
master-key. Happy was the time”—and the fellow’s sullen
eye lighted up with the joy of knavery—“when I could walk
through every cabinet, chamber, and cell from the Emperor’s
palace in Rome down to the Emperor’s dungeon in Cæsarea.”</p>

<p>I produced a few coins which I had been enabled to conceal,
and flung them into his hand. The sum rekindled life in him;
avarice has its enthusiasts as well as superstition. He forgot
danger, prison, and even my dagger at the sight of his idol.
He turned the coins to the light in all possible ways; he tried
them with his teeth; he tasted, he kissed, he pressed them
to his bosom. Never was lover more rapturous than this last
of human beings at the touch of money in the midst of
wretchedness and ruin. His transports taught me a lesson,
and in that prison and from that slave of vice I learned long
to tremble at the power of gold over the human mind.</p>

<p>It was past midnight and the noise of the criminals round
me had already sunk away. The floor was strewn with sleepers,
and the only waking figure was the sentinel as he trod
wearily along the passages, when the Egyptian, desiring me
to feign sleep that his further operations might not be embarrassed,
drew himself along the ground toward him. The soldier,
a huge Dacian, covered with beard and iron, and going
his rounds with the insensibility of a machine, all but trod
upon the Egyptian, who lay crouching and writhing before
him. I saw the spear lifted up and heard a growl that made
me think my envoy’s career at an end in this world. He still
lay on the ground, writhing under the sentinel’s foot, as a
serpent might under the paw of a lion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sentinel Bribed</div>

<p>I was about to spring up and interpose, but his time was
not yet come. The spear hung in air, gradually turned its
point upward, and finally resumed its seat of peace on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Dacian’s shoulder. That art of persuasion which speaks to
the palm and whose language is of all nations had touched
the son of Thrace; I heard the sound of the coin on the marble;
a few words arranged the details. The sentinel discovered
that his vigilance was required in another direction, broke
off his customary round, and walked away. The Egyptian
turned to me with a triumphant smile on his hideous visage,
the gate rolled on its hinge, and he slipped out like a shadow.</p>

<p>At the instant my mind misgave me. I had put the fate of
my family into the hands of a slave, destitute of even the
pretense of principle. In my eagerness to save, might I not
have been delivering them up to their enemy? He had sold
Onias to me; might he not make his peace by selling me to
Onias? The gate was still open. A few steps would put me
beyond bondage. Yet I had come to claim Esther. If I left
the camp, what hope was there of my ever seeing this child
of my heart again? Would not every hour of my life be embittered
by the chance that she might be suffering the miseries
of a dungeon, or borne away into a strange land, or dying and
calling on her father for help in vain?</p>

<p>Those contending impulses passed through my mind with
the speed and almost with the agony of an arrow. The more
I thought of the Egyptian, the more I took his treachery for
certain. But the present ruin of all predominated over the
possible sufferings of one, and with a heart throbbing almost
to suffocation and a step scarcely able to move I dragged myself
toward the portal.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Eleazar the Convert</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The War of
Extermination</div>

<p>I was not to escape! As I reached the gate a loud sound
of trampling feet and many voices drove me back. By that
curious texture of the feelings which prefers suffering to suspense
I was almost glad to have the question decided for me
by fortune, and flung myself on the ground among a heap of
the undone, who lay enjoying a slumber that might be envied
by thrones. The gate was thrown open and in another moment
in burst a living mass of horror, a multitude of beings in
whom the human face and form were almost obliterated;
shapes gaunt with famine, black with dust, withered with
deadly fatigue, and covered with gashes and gore.</p>

<p>The war had gone on from cruelty to cruelty. To the
Roman the Jew was a rebel, and he had a rebel’s treatment;
to the Jew the Roman was a tyrant, and dearly was the price
of his tyranny exacted. Quarter was seldom given on either
side. The natural generosity of the son of Vespasian had attempted
for a while to soften this furious system. But the
slaughter of the mission exasperated him; he declared the
Jews a people incapable of faith, and proclaimed a war of extermination.
The battle of the day had furnished the first
opportunity of sweeping vengeance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel among the Wounded</div>

<p>The people, stimulated by the arrival of Onias, had made a
desperate effort to force the Roman lines. The attacks were
reiterated with more than valor—with rage and madness; the
Jews fought with a disregard of life that appalled and had
nearly overwhelmed even the Roman steadiness. The loss
of the legions was formidable; all their chief officers were
wounded, many were killed. Titus himself, leading a column
from the Decuman gate of the camp, was wounded by a blow
from a sling; and the state of its ramparts, as I saw them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
daybreak, torn down in immense breaches, and filling up the
ditch with their ruins, showed the imminent hazard of the
whole army. Another hour of daylight would probably have
been its ruin. But Judea would not have been the more
secure, for the factions, relieved from the presence of an
enemy, would have torn each other to pieces.</p>

<p>The loss of the Jews was so prodigious<a name="ENanchor_52" id="ENanchor_52"></a><a href="#Endnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as to be accounted
for only by their eagerness to throw away life. Not
less than a hundred thousand corpses lay between the camp
and Jerusalem. No prisoners were taken on either side, and
the crowds that now approached were the wounded, gathered
off the field, to be crucified in memory of the mission. The
coming of those victims put an end to the possibility or the
desire of sleep.</p>

<p>The immense and gloomy hall, one of those in use for the
stately banquets customary among the leaders of Jerusalem,
was suddenly a blaze of torches. The malefactors and captives
were thrown together in heaps, guarded by strong detachments
of spearmen that lined the sides, like ranges of iron
statues, overlooking the mixed and moving confusion of
wretched life between. Guilt, sorrow, and shame were there
in their dreadful undisguise. The roof rang to oaths and
screams of pain as the wounded tossed and rolled upon each
other; rang to bitter lamentation, and more bitter still, to
those self-accusing outcries which the near approach of violent
death sometimes awakens in the most daring criminals. For
stern as the justice was, it still was justice; the Jewish character
had fearfully changed. Rapine and bloodshed had become
the habits of the populace, and among the panting and
quivering wretches before me begging a moment of life I
recognized many a face that, seen in Jerusalem, was the sign
of plunder and massacre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fury of the Condemned</div>

<p>Repulsive as my recollections were, I spent the greater part
of the night in bandaging their wounds and relieving the
thirst which scarcely less than their wounds wrung them.
There were women, too, among those wrecks of the sword,
and now that the frenzy of the day was past, they exhibited
a picture of the most heart-breaking dejection. Lying on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
ground wounded and with every lineament of their former
selves disfigured, they cried from that living grave alternately
for vengeance and for mercy. Then tearing their hair and
flinging it, as their last mark of hatred and scorn, at the
legionaries, they devoted them to ruin in the name of the
God of Israel. Then passion gave way to pain, and in floods
of tears they called on the names of parent, husband, and
child, whom they were to see no more!</p>

<p>It was known that at daybreak the prisoners were to die,
and the din of hammers and the creaking of wagons bearing
the crosses broke the night with horrid intimation. At length
the stillness terribly told that all was prepared. The night,
measured by moments, seemed endless, and many a longing
was uttered for the dawn that was to put them out of their
misery. Yet when the first gray light fell through the casements
and the trumpets sounded for the escort to get under
arms, nothing could exceed the fury of the crowd. Some
rushed upon the spears of the reluctant soldiery; some
bounded in mad antics through the hall; others fell on their
knees and offered up horrid and shuddering prayers; many
flung themselves upon the floor, and in the paroxysm of wrath
and fear perished.</p>

<p>Shocked and sickened by this misery, I withdrew from the
gate, where the tumult was thickest, as the soldiery were already
driving them out, and returned to my old lair, to await
the will of fortune. But I found it occupied. A circle of the
wounded were standing round a speaker, to whom they listened
with singular attention. The voice caught my ear; from the
crowd round him I was unable to observe his features, but
once drawn within the sound of his words, I shared the general
interest in their extraordinary power. He was a teacher
of the new religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Teachers of Christianity</div>

<p>In my wanderings through Judea I had often met with
those Nazarenes. Their doctrines had a vivid simplicity that
might have attracted my attention as a philosopher, but
philosophy was cold to their power. The splendor and
strength of their preaching realized the boldest traditions of
oratory. Yet their triumph was not that of oratory; they disclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
all pretension to eloquence or learning, declaring that
even if they possessed them, they dared not sully by human
instruments of success the glory due to Heaven. They carried
this self-denial to the singular extent of divulging every circumstance
calculated to deprive themselves and their doctrines
of popularity. They openly acknowledged that they were of
humble birth and occupation, sinners like the rest of mankind,
and in some instances guilty of former excesses of blind
zeal, persecutors of the new religion, even to blood. Of their
Master they spoke with the same openness. They told of His
humble origin, His career of rejection, and His death by the
punishment of a slave. To the scoffer at their hopes of a kingdom
to be given by the sufferer of that ignominious death, they
unhesitatingly answered that their hope was founded expressly
upon His death, and that they lived and rejoiced in the expectation
that they were, like Him, to seal their faith with
their blood!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Strength of the New Religion</div>

<p>I had often seen enthusiasm among my countrymen, but this
was a spirit of a distinct and a loftier birth. It had the vigor
of enthusiasm without its rashness; the gentleness of infancy,
with the wisdom of years; the solemn reverence of the Jew
for the divine Will, free from his jealous claims to the sole
possession of truth. The Law and the Prophets were perpetually
in their hands, and they often embarrassed our
haughty doctors and acrid Pharisees with questions and interpretations
to which no reply could be returned but a sneer
or an anathema. But in the power of conviction, in the
master art of striking the heart and understanding with sudden
light, like the bolt from heaven, I never heard, I never shall
hear, their equals. To call it eloquence was to humiliate this
stupendous gift; the most practised skill of the rhetorician
gave way before it, like gossamer, like chaff before the whirlwind.
It broke its way through sophistry by the mere weight
of thought. It had a rapid reality that swept the hearer along.
In its disdain of the mere decorations of speech, in the bold
and naked nerve of its language, there was an irresistible
energy—the energy of the tempest, giving proof in its untamable
rushings of its descent from a region beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
reach of man. I never listened to one of these preachers but
with a consciousness that he was the depository of mighty
knowledge. He had the whole mystery of the human affections
bare to his eye. Among a thousand hearts one word
sent conviction at the same instant. All their diversities
of feeling, sorrow, and error were shaken at once by that
universal language. It talked to the soul!</p>

<p>Of these overwhelming appeals, which often lasted for
hours together and to which I listened overwhelmed, nothing
is left to posterity but a few fragments, and those letters
which the Christians still preserve among their sacred writings—great
productions and giving all the impression that
it is possible to transmit to the future. But the living voice,
the illumined countenance, the frame glowing and instinct
with inspiration!—what can transmit them?</p>

<p>“Here,” said I, as I often stood and heard their voices
thundering over the multitude, “here is the true power that
is to shake the temples of heathenism. Here is a new element
come to overthrow or to renovate the world.”</p>

<p>I saw our holy law struggling to keep itself in existence,
compressed on every side by idolatry; a little fountain feebly
urging its way through its native rocks, but exhausted and
dried up at the moment it reached the plain. But here was
an ocean, an inexhaustible depth and breadth of power made
to roll round the world, and be, at the will of Providence, the
illimitable instrument of its bounty. I saw our holy law
feebly sheltering under its despoiled and insulted ordinances
the truth of Heaven. But here was a religion scorning a narrower
temple than the earth and the heaven!</p>

<div class="sidenote">“The Hour is Come”</div>

<p>Yet I turned away from those convictions. A thousand
times I was on the point of throwing myself at the feet of
the men who bore this transcendent gift and asking: “What
shall I do?” A thousand times I could have cried out: “Almost
thou persuadest me to be a Christian.” But oh, my
doubting heart! I make no attempt to account for myself or
my career—I have felt as strongly driven back as if there
were an actual hand forcing me away. The illusion was a
willing one, and it was suffered, like all such, to hold me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
its captivity. But even when I shrank away I have said:
“Whence had those men this knowledge? If angels from God
were to come down to reclaim the world, could they tell
us things different or tell us more?”</p>

<p>I looked round upon the labors of ancient wisdom, and I
saw how trivial a space its utmost vigor had cleared, and how
soon even that space was overrun by the rankness of the
world, and I said: “Here is the central fire, the mighty reservoir
of light, awaiting but the divine command to burst up
in splendor, consume the impurities of the world at once, and
regenerate mankind.” But the veil was upon my face. I
labored against conviction, and shutting out the subject from
my thoughts, sternly determined to live and die in the faith of
my fathers.</p>

<p>I now heard but the few and simple closing words of the
speaker in this group of the devoted. He was sorrowful that
the Gospel had been so long committed to his hands in vain.
He had, through fear of his own inadequacy, and in the remaining
deference to the prejudices of his people, suffered
the truth to decay, and seen the illustrious labors of the
apostles without following their example.</p>

<p>“But,” said he, “I was rebuked; the opportunity once neglected
was refused even to my prayers. I was thenceforth in
perils, in civil war, in domestic sedition. I am but now come
from a dungeon. But in my bonds it pleased Him, in whose
hand are the heavens, to visit me. I knelt and prayed,
acknowledging my sin, and beseeching Him that before I died
I might proclaim His truth before Israel. In that hour came
a voice, bidding me go forth; and lo! my chains fell from
my hands and I went forth. And when I came to the gates of
the dungeon, I willed to go forward to the city of David.
But I was forbidden, and my steps were turned here, to
awake my brethren to knowledge before they perish.”</p>

<p>The trumpets rang again as a new crowd were drained off
to execution. My heart sank at the melancholy sound, but
among the converts there was not a murmur.</p>

<p>“Kneel,” said the preacher; “the hour is come!”</p>

<p>They knelt and he poured out his spirit aloud in prayer</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“Go Forth,
Redeemed
of the Lord”</div>

<p>“Now go forth,” he said, rising alone, “go forth, redeemed
of the Lord. This night have ye known that He is gracious.
Those things that God before hath shown by the mouth of
all His prophets that Christ should suffer, He hath fulfilled.
But ye have heard, but ye have been converted, that your sins
may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come.
But ye have been called—but ye have been justified—but ye
shall be glorified. Our hope of you is stedfast—knowing
that as you have been partakers of His cross, so shall ye be
of His kingdom. Now be grace unto you, and peace from
the King of Kings!”</p>

<p>He laid his hands upon the kneeling converts and went
slowly round, blessing them. His face had been hitherto
turned from me, and I was too much impressed by his words
and the awful circumstances in which he stood even to conjecture
who he was. At length in moving round he came before
me. To my inexpressible surprise and sorrow the teacher
was Eleazar! I had lost every trace of him since we parted
in the fortress, and with sorrow of heart had concluded him
a sacrifice to the common atrocities of our ferocious war. His
long absence was now explained, but no explanation could
account for the extraordinary change that had been wrought
upon his countenance. Always generous and manly, yet the
softness of a nature made for domestic life had concealed the
vigor of his understanding. He was the general reconciler in
the disputes of the neighboring districts, the impartial judge,
the unwearied friend, and his features had borne the stamp of
this quiet career.</p>

<p>But the man before me bore uncontrollable energy in every
tone and feature. The failing flame of the torch that burned
over his head was enough to show the transformation of his
countenance into grandeur; his glance was a living fire; the
hair that floated over it, changed by captivity to the whiteness
of snow, shaded a forehead that seemed to have suddenly
expanded into majesty. If I had met such a man in a desert,
I should have augured in him the founder or the subverter
of a throne.</p>

<p>While I stood absolutely awed by his presence, a cohort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
spearmen poured in to gather up the gleanings of the hall.
Then was renewed the scene of misery. Wretches whom I had
thought dead started from the ground and flung themselves at
their feet, or rushed against the ranks, tore the weapons out
of their hands, and broke them in fury through the hall.
Others dashed their foreheads against the walls and floor and
died upon the spot. Others sprang up the projections of the
sculpture and climbed with the agility of leopards to the roof,
to force the casements. But additional troops poured in, and
the crowd were overwhelmed and driven out to undergo their
destiny.</p>

<p>During this long tumult, the Christian converts continued
kneeling and evidently absorbed by thoughts that extinguished
fear. Even the sounds from without, that terribly told what
was going on, and every tone of which pierced me to the
heart, produced only a deeper supplication that light would
be given to the souls of the sufferers. This patience probably
induced the soldiery to leave them to the last, while they
drove out the more untractable at the point of the spear, like
cattle to the slaughter. I still stood aloof. The sacredness of
the moments that came before death were not to be interrupted.
The transformed Eleazar had already passed away
from the things of this world. I would not force them on him
again, nor vainly and cruelly disturb the holy serenity of one
at peace alike with man and Heaven.</p>

<p>At length the order came.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Go to the
Kingdom of
Glory”</div>

<p>“Now, my beloved brothers, beloved in the Lord, go
forth,” said Eleazar, with a noble exultation glowing in his
countenance, “quit ye like men; be strong; fear not them
who can kill only the body. Even this night saw you still in
your sins—the wisdom that was before all worlds, hidden from
you. But He that calleth light out of darkness hath wrought
in you. He hath poured upon you that Spirit which is an
earnest of your inheritance, holy, incorruptible, eternal in the
heavens. Now, sons of Abraham, redeemed of Christ, kings
and priests of God forever, go where He is gone to prepare a
place for you—go to the house of many mansions—go to the
kingdom of glory!”</p>

<p>With tears and blessings Eleazar took water and baptized
the converts. They sang a hymn, and then rising, moved
toward the gate, the soldiers standing at a distance and looking
on at this more than heroic resignation with eyes of respect
and wonder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Confronts
Eleazar</div>

<p>I could restrain myself no longer. I grasped Eleazar; he
instantly recognized me, and the color that shot through his
cheek showed that with me came a tide of memory. I was
speechless; I embraced him; tears of old friendship dimmed
my eyes. He was overpowered like myself, and could only
exclaim:</p>

<p>“Salathiel, my brother! What misfortune has brought you
here? Where is Miriam? Where are your children? You
can not be a prisoner? Fly from this dreadful place!”</p>

<p>“Never, my brother, unless I can save you. The tyrants
shall have the curse of both upon their heads.”</p>

<p>“This is madness, Salathiel—impiety! Oh, that you were
this moment even as I am—in all but death! It is your duty
to live; you have many ties to the world.”</p>

<p>He paused, and with a look upward said in a tone of prayer:</p>

<p>“Oh, that you were at this moment awake to the truths, the
holy and imperishable consolations, that make the cross to me
more triumphant than a throne!”</p>

<p>The theme was a painful one. He instantly saw my perturbation
and forebore to urge me; but fixing his humid eyes
on heaven, and with uplifted hands, he gave me his parting
benediction.</p>

<p>“May the time come,” said he, “when the veil shall be
taken away from the face of my unhappy kindred and of my
undone country! When the days of the desolation of Israel
come to be accomplished, let her kneel before the altar!—let
her weep in sackcloth and repent of her iniquities; so shall
the sun of glory arise upon her once more.”</p>

<p>Then, as if a flash of knowledge had darted into his soul,
he fixed his solemn gaze on me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Day of Brightness</div>

<p>“Salathiel, you are not fit to die; pray that you may not
now sink into the grave. You have fierce impulses, of whose
power you have yet no conception. Supplicate for length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
years; rather endure all the miseries of exile; be alone upon
the earth—weary, wild, and desolate; but pray that you may
not die until you know the truths that Israel yet shall know.
Let it be for me to die, and seal my faith by my blood. Let
it be for you to live, and seal it by your penitence. But live
in hope. Even on earth, a day bright beyond earthly splendor,
lovely beyond all the visions of beauty, magnificent and powerful
beyond the loftiest thought of human nature, shall
come, and we, even we, my brother, shall on earth meet
again.”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Clemency of Titus</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Supplication</div>

<p>There was a thrilling influence in the words of Eleazar that
left me without reply, and for a while I stood absorbed.
When I raised my eyes again, I saw him following the melancholy
train down the valley of slaughter. I rushed after him.
He would not listen to my entreaties; he would suffer no ransom
to be offered for his life. I supplicated the tribune of
the escort for a moment’s delay until I could solicit mercy
from Titus. The officer, himself deeply pained by the service
on which he was ordered, had no authority, but sent a centurion
with me to the general commanding.</p>

<p>I hurried my guide through the immense force drawn up to
witness the offering to the shades of the Roman senators and
soldiers. The morning was stormy, and clouds covering the
ridges of the hills darkened the feeble dawn so much that
torches were necessary to direct the movement of the troops.
The wind came howling through the spears and standards, but
with it came the fiercer sounds of human agony. As we
reached the entrance of the valley, the centurion pointed to a
height where the general stood in the midst of a group of
mounted officers, wrapped in their cloaks against the snows
that came furiously whirling from the hills. I darted up the
steep with a rapidity that left my companion far below, and
implored the Roman humanity for my countrymen and for my
noble and innocent brother.</p>

<p>On my knee, that I had never before bowed to man, I besought
the muffled form, whom I took for the illustrious son
of Vespasian, to spare men “whose only crime was that of
having defended their country.” I adjured the heir of the
empire “to rescue from an ignominious fate, subjects driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
into revolt only by violences which he would be the first to
disown.”</p>

<p>“If,” exclaimed I, “you demand money for the lives of my
countrymen, it shall be given even to our last ounce of silver;
if you would have territory, we will give up our lands and go
forth exiles. If you must have life for life, take mine, and
let my brother go free!”</p>

<p>The form slowly removed the cloak and Cestius was before
me.</p>

<p>“So,” said he, with a malignant smile, “you can kneel,
Jew, and play the rhetorician; however, as you are here,
your having escaped me once is no reason why you should
laugh at justice a second time. Here, Torquatus,” he beckoned
to a centurion, “take this rebel to the crosses and bring me
an account of the way in which he behaves. You see, Jew,
that I have some care of your reputation. A fellow careless
as you are would probably have died like a slave in a skirmish;
but you shall now figure before your countrymen as a
patriot should, and die with the honors of a native rebel.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Valley of
the Crosses</div>

<p>I disdained to answer. The officer came up, attended by
his spearmen, and I was led down to the valley. A storm of
extraordinary violence, long gathering on the sky, broke forth
as I descended, and it was only by grasping the rocks and
shrubs on the side of the declivity that we could avoid being
blown away. We staggered along, blinded, and half frozen.
The storm fell heavily upon the legions, and the heights were
quickly abandoned for the shelter of the valley. The valley
itself was a sheet of snow, torn up by blasts that drifted it
hazardously upon the troops and threw everything into confusion.
But the sight that opened on me as I passed the first
gorge effaced storm and soldiery, and might have effaced the
world, from my mind. Through the whole extent of the naked
and rocky hollow were planted crosses. The ravine, dark even
in sunshine, was now black as midnight, and its only light was
from the scattered torches and the fires into which the bodies
of the victims were flung as they died, to make room for
others. On those crosses hung hundreds, writhing in miseries
made only to show the hideous capability of suffering that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
exists in our frame. I was instantly recognized, and many a
hand was stretched out to me imploring that I should mercifully
hasten death. I heard my name called on as their prince,
their leader, their countryman; I heard voices calling on
me to remember and revenge! Horror-struck, I raved at the
legionaries and their tyrant master until I sank upon the
ground in exhaustion, covering my head with my mantle that
I might exclude alike sight and sound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Awed
by a Face</div>

<p>A voice at my side aroused me; a cross had just been fixed
on the spot, and at its foot stood, preparing for death, the
man who had spoken. I looked upon his face and gave an involuntary
cry. For seven-and-thirty years I had not seen that
face; but I had seen it on a <span class="smcapuc">NIGHT</span> never to be erased from
my remembrance or my soul! I knew every feature of it
through all the changes of years!</p>

<p>Manhood had passed into age; the bold and sanguine countenance
was furrowed with cares and crimes. But I knew at
once the man who had on that night been foremost at my call;
the daring rabble-leader who had first shouted at my fatal
summons, and maddened the multitude, as I had maddened
myself and him. He turned his glance upon me at the cry.
His pale visage grew black as death. The past flashed upon
his soul. He shook from head to foot with keen convulsion.
He gasped and tried to speak, but no words came. He beat
his breast wildly and pointed to the cross with dreadful meaning.
The executioner, a brutal slave, scoffed at him as a dastard.
He heard nothing, but with his pallid eyes staring on
me and his hand pointed upward, stood stiffening. Life departed
as he stood! The executioner, impatient, laid his
grasp upon him, but he was beyond the power of man. He
fell backward like a pillar of stone!</p>

<p>I started from the corpse, and utterly unnerved, looked
wildly round for some way of escape from this scene of despair.
As I tried to penetrate the dusk toward the bottom of
the valley, Eleazar was seen at the head of his little band,
standing at the foot of a cross, surrounded by soldiers. I
thought no more of safety, and plunging into the valley, forced
my way through the rocks and snowdrifts until I reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
foot of the declivity on which this true hero was about to die.
But there an impenetrable fence of spears stopped me. I implored,
execrated, struggled; Eleazar’s look fell on me, and
the smile on his uplifted countenance showed at once how
much he thanked me and how calmly he was prepared to bid
the world farewell. My struggles were useless, and I had but
one resource more. I flew with a swiftness that baffled pursuit
to the camp; passed the entrenchments by the breaches left
since the battle, and before I could be stopped or questioned,
entered the tent of Titus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">News from
Rome</div>

<p>The supper-lamps were burning, and three stately-looking
men still lingered over the table, one of the few unpopular
luxuries of the general. A large packet of letters was being
distributed by a page, and while I stood in the shade of the
tent-curtain a moment, until I should ascertain whether Titus
was among the three, I was made the unwilling sharer of the
secrets of Rome.</p>

<p>“All is going on well,” said one of the readers; “here, that
truest of courtiers, my showy friend, Statilius, sends, compiled
by his own hand, an endless list of the pomps and processions,
games and congratulations, in the Emperor’s progress
through Italy. The intelligence is not the newest in the
world, but it would break my courtly friend’s heart to think
that he had not the happiness of giving it first. So let him
think, and so let him worship the rising sun, until another
dynasty comes, and he discovers that if this sun has risen in
the East, a much finer one may rise in the West. Thus runs
the world.”</p>

<p>“War with the Britons,” read another; “they have
marched a hundred of their naked clans from the hills. The
remnant of the Druids are busy again with their incantations,
and it is more than suspected that the whole is stirred up by
our incomparable governor of western Gaul, who affects the
diadem, like all the ridiculous governors of the age.”</p>

<p>“Well then, he shall have his wish,” said a third, “the
Emperor will give him, of course, a court fit for a rebel: his
council, lictors; and his palace, the Mamertine. But as to
the Britons, I doubt if they care one of their own leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
pence whether he wears the diadem or the halter. The savages
have probably been vexed by some new attempt to
squeeze money from them—the quickest way to try the national
sensibilities. They have the spirit of trade in them already,
and are as keen in the barter of their wolf-skins and
bulls’-hides as if they supplied the world with Tyrian canopies
and Indian pearls.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Letter from
Sempronius</div>

<p>“A letter from Sempronius!” was the next topic; “its exquisite
intaglio and elaborate perfumes would betray it all the
world over; full of scandals, as usual, and full of discontent.
He seems quite dismantled, and complains that—the sex is
growing ugly, the seasons comfortless, and mankind dull; a
certain sign that my emptiest of friends and the best dresser
in Italy is growing old.”</p>

<p>“So much the better for his circle,” said another, sipping
his goblet. “As for himself, while he can flourish in curls
and calumny, he will be happy, the true man of high life, a
prey to tailors, a figure for actors to burlesque, and an inveterate
weariness to the world.”</p>

<p>“But here is a private despatch from the Emperor, and,
unfortunately for human eyes, written in his own most unreadable
hand.”</p>

<p>The speaker stood up to the lamp and gave me an opportunity
of observing him. His countenance and figure struck
me as what no other word could express than—princely.<a name="ENanchor_53" id="ENanchor_53"></a><a href="#Endnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
The features were handsome and strongly marked Italian,
and the form, tho tending to breadth and rather under the
usual stature, was eminently dignified. His voice, too, was
remarkable. I never heard one that more completely united
softness and majesty. Here I could have but the shadow of
a doubt that I had found Titus; yet I had that shadow. Our
meeting in the field, where we had fought hand to hand, gave
me no recollection of the man before me. Titus might not
even be among the three, and nothing but seizure and ruin could
be the consequence of discovering myself to subordinates.</p>

<p>“Good news, it is to be hoped,” said both the listeners together
as they deferentially watched his perusal.</p>

<p>“None whatever; a mere private chronicle in the Emperor’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
usual style; all kinds of oddities together. He laughs at me
for complaining of the want of intelligence from Rome, and
says that unless we send him some, the politicians of the city
will die of emptiness or raise a rebellion; and that he is the
most ill-used personage in the empire in being obliged to supply
brains for so many blockheads and keep up the reputation of
an honest man in the midst of so many knaves. But he mentions,
and for that I am deeply grateful, that he has just
erected the golden statue, which I vowed so long ago to the
memory of my unfortunate friend Britannicus, and is about
to dedicate a bronze equestrian one to me, to be placed in the
Circus. He concludes the epistle by saying that unless the
British insurrection speedily blows over, he shall be a beggar,
and must turn tribune for a livelihood; defends his impracticable
manuscript, which, he says, I am imitating as fast as
I can, and repeats his old jest, that if I were not born to be a
prince and an idler, I might have made my bread by my
talents for forgery.”</p>

<p>His hearers repaid the imperial merriment by its full tribute
of loyal laughter.</p>

<p>Doubt was now at an end, and I advanced. My step roused
the party, and they started up, drawing their swords. But
the quick eye of Titus recognized me, and satisfying his companions
by a gesture, I heard him pronounce to them: “My
antagonist, the prince of Naphtali.”</p>

<p>There was no time for ceremony, and I addressed him at
once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Appeals
to Titus</div>

<p>“Son of Vespasian, you are a soldier, and know what is
due to the brave. I come to solicit your mercy; it is the first
time that I ever stooped to solicit man. My brother, a chieftain
of Israel, is in your hands, condemned to the horrid death
of the cross; he is virtuous, brave, and noble; save him, and
you will do an act of justice more honorable to your name
than the bloodiest victory.”</p>

<p>Titus looked at me in silence, and was evidently perplexed;
then he returned to his chair, and having consulted with his
companions, hesitatingly said:</p>

<p>“Prince, you know not what you have asked. I am bound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
like others, by the Emperor’s commands, and they strictly are,
that none of your countrymen, taken after the offer of peace,
must live.”</p>

<p>“Hear this, God of Israel!” I cried; “King of Vengeance,
hear and remember!”</p>

<p>“You are rash, prince,” said Titus gravely; “yet I can
forgive your national temper. With others, even your venturing
here might bring you into hazard. But the perfidy of
your people makes truce and treaty impossible. They leave
me no alternative. I lament the necessity. It is the desire
of the illustrious Vespasian to reign in peace. But this is
now at an end.”</p>

<p>He paused, and advancing toward me, offered his hand with
the words: “I know that there are brave and high-minded
men among your nation. I have been astonished at the valor,
nay, I will call it the daring and heroic contempt of suffering
and death, that this siege has already shown. I have been
witness, too,” and he smiled, “of the prince of Naphtali’s
prowess in the field, and I would most willingly have such
among my friends.”</p>

<p>I waited for the conclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Offer of
Titus</div>

<p>“Why not come among us,” he said; “give up a resistance
that must end in ruin; abandon a cause that all the world
sees to be desperate; save yourself from popular caprice, the
violence of your rancorous factions, and the final fall of your
city? Be Cæsar’s friend, and name what possession, power,
or rank you will.”</p>

<p>The thought of deserting the cause of Jerusalem was profanation.
I drew back and looked at the majestic Roman as
if I saw the original tempter before me.</p>

<p>“Son of Vespasian, I am at this hour a poor man; I may
in the next be an exile or a slave. I have ties to life as strong
as ever were bound round the heart of man; I stand here a
suppliant for the life of one whose loss would embitter mine!
Yet not for wealth unlimited, for the safety of my family,
for the life of the noble victim that is now standing at the
place of torture, dare I abandon, dare I think the impious
thought of abandoning, the cause of the City of Holiness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>The picture of her ruin rose before my eyes, and tears
forced their way; my strength was dissolved; my voice was
choked. The Romans fixed their looks on the ground, affected
by the sincerity of a soldier’s sorrow. I took the hand that
was again offered.</p>

<p>“Titus! in the name of that Being to whom the wisdom of
the earth is folly, I adjure you to beware. Jerusalem is
sacred. Her crimes have often wrought her misery—often
has she been trampled by the armies of the stranger. But she
is still the City of the Omnipotent, and never was blow inflicted
on her by man that was not terribly repaid. Hear me
a moment.”</p>

<p>Titus stood at this, and I continued:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Passing of
Power</div>

<p>“The Assyrian came, the mightiest power of the world; he
plundered her Temple and led her people into captivity. How
long was it before his empire was a dream, his dynasty extinguished
in blood, and an enemy on his throne? The Persian
came; from her protector he turned into her oppressor, and
his empire was swept away like the dust of the desert! The
Syrian smote her; the smiter died in agonies of remorse, and
where is his kingdom now? The Egyptian smote her, and who
now sits on the throne of the Ptolemies? Pompey came—the
invincible conqueror of a thousand cities, the light of Rome,
the lord of Asia riding on the very wings of victory. But he
profaned her Temple, and from that hour he went down—down,
like a millstone plunged into the ocean! Blind counsel,
rash ambition, womanish fears were upon the great statesman
and warrior of Rome. Where does he sleep? What sands
were colored with his blood? The universal conqueror died a
slave by the hands of a slave! Crassus came at the head of
the legions; he plundered the sacred vessels of the sanctuary.
Vengeance followed him, and he was cursed by the curse of
God. Where are the bones of the robber, and his host? Go
tear them from the jaws of the lion and the wolf of Parthia—their
fitting tomb!</p>

<p>“You, too, son of Vespasian, may be commissioned for the
punishment of a stiff-necked and rebellious people. You may
scourge our naked vice by the force of arms; and then you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
may return to your own land, exulting in the conquest of the
fiercest enemy of Rome. But shall you escape the common
fate of the instrument of evil? Shall you see a peaceful old
age? Shall a son of yours ever sit upon the throne? Shall
not rather some monster of your blood efface the memory of
your virtues, and make Rome in bitterness of soul curse the
Flavian name?”</p>

<p>Titus grew pale, and shuddering, covered his eyes with his
mantle. His companions stood gazing on me with the aspect
of men gazing on the messenger of fate.</p>

<p>“Spare Eleazar,” was all that I could utter.</p>

<p>Titus made a sign to a tribune, who flew to bear, if not too
late, the command of mercy.</p>

<p>While we continued in a silence that none of us felt inclined
to break, a door opened behind me and an officer entered.
It was Septimius. I seized him by the throat.</p>

<p>“Villain!” I cried, “give me back my child; base hypocrite!
give up my innocent daughter. Where have you taken
her? Lead me to her, or die!”</p>

<p>Titus rose, in evident surprise and indignation.</p>

<p>“What do I hear, Septimius? Have you been guilty of this
offense? Prince, let him loose until his general shall hear
what he has to say for himself.”</p>

<p>Septimius affected the most extreme and easy ignorance.</p>

<p>“Most noble Titus, I have to thank you for having saved my
neck from the grasp of this hasty personage; but beyond that
I have nothing to say for myself or any one else. I never saw
this man before. I know no more of his daughter than of the
queen of Abyssinia, or the three-formed Diana; and by the
goddess, I swear that I believe him to be perfectly under her
influence, and either a lunatic or a most excellent actor. Be
honest, Jew, if you can, and acknowledge that you never saw
me before in your life.”</p>

<p>I stood in astonishment; his effrontery struck me dumb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Warned of an Assassin</div>

<p>“You perceive, most noble Titus,” he went on, “how a
plain question puts an end to this public accuser’s charges.
But in his present state, whether affected or real, he should
not be suffered to go at large; suffer me to send him to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
quarters, where he shall be guarded, until we at least find out
what brought him here.”</p>

<p>“Ingrate,” I exclaimed, “you make me hate human nature!
Better that I had left you to be trampled like the viper that
you are.”</p>

<p>The dark eye of the general, again turned on Septimius,
seemed to require a graver explanation.</p>

<p>“Ingrate!” retorted he. “By Jupiter, the fellow’s insolence
is superb. For what should I be grateful? but for my escape
from his detestable hands. Very probably he figured among
the rabble that would have murdered me as they did the rest
of us; grateful, yes, I ought to be for the lesson never to
venture within his walls on the faith of the traitors that hold
them. But let me be allowed to say, most noble Titus, that
you condescend too much in listening to any of this rabble;
nay, that you hazard the safety of the state in hazarding your
person within the reach of one of a race of assassins.”</p>

<p>Titus smiled, and waved back his companions, who, on the
surmise, were approaching him.</p>

<p>“Let me be honored with your commands,” urged Septimius,
“to take this person in charge; felon or insane, I shall
speedily put him in the way of cure.”</p>

<p>A tribune, breathless with haste, came in at the moment
with a letter, which he gave to Titus, and retired to a distant
part of the tent to await the answer. The color rose to the
Roman’s cheek as he looked over the paper; he showed it to
his companions, and then put it into my hand. I read the
words:</p>

<p>“An assassin, hired by the chiefs of Jerusalem, yesterday
passed the gates. His object is the life of the Roman general.
He goes under the pretense of recovering one of his family,
supposed to be carried off from the city, but who has never
left his house. He has communications with the camp, by
which he can enter at pleasure, and the noble Titus can not be
too much on his guard.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Held in Custody</div>

<p>The note was in an enclosure from Cestius, stating that it
had just been transmitted to him from a high authority in
Jerusalem. I flung it on the ground with the scorn due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
such an accusation, declaring that it was unnecessary for “my
enemy Cestius to have put his name to a document which so
easily revealed its writer.”</p>

<p>“You, of course, Septimius,” said the general, fixing his
penetrating gaze on him, “could know nothing of this letter.”</p>

<p>Septimius entered on his defense with seriousness, and
showed that from the time and circumstances no share in it
could be attached to him. Titus retired a few steps, and having
consulted with the officers, who I perceived were unanimous
for my being instantly put to death, addressed me in
that grave and silver-toned voice which characterized the singular
composure of his nature.</p>

<p>“We have exchanged blows and pledges of honor, prince,
and I will not suffer myself to believe that a man of your
rank and soldiership could stoop to the crime charged here.
In truth, were none but personal considerations in question, I
should instantly set you free. But there are weighty interests
connected with my life, which make it seem fitting to my
friends and advisers that in all cases precautions should be
taken which otherwise I should disdain. To satisfy their
minds, and the spirit of the Emperor’s orders, I must detain
you for a few days. Your treatment shall be honorable.”</p>

<p>Septimius advanced again to demand my custody, but a
look repelled the request, and I was directed to follow one of
the secretaries of Titus.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Treatment of a Prisoner</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A Favored
Prisoner</div>

<p>A troop of cavalry were at the tent door. We set off
through the storm, and a few miles from the camp reached a
large building peopled with a crowd of high functionaries attached
to Titus as governor of Judea.</p>

<p>“You must be a prodigious favorite with the general,” said
my companion, as we passed through a range of magnificent
rooms furnished with Italian luxury, “or he would never have
sent you here. He had these chambers prepared for his own
residence, but your countrymen have kept him too busy, and
for the last month he is indebted to them for sleeping under
canvas.”</p>

<p>I observed that “peace was the first wish of my heart, but
that no people could be reproached with contending too boldly
for freedom.”</p>

<p>“The sentiment is Roman,” was the reply. “But let us
come to the fact. Titus, once fixed in the government, would
be worth all the fantasies that ever fed the declaimers on independence.
His character is peace, and if he ever comes to
the empire, he will make the first of monarchs. You should
try him and reap the first fruits of his talent for making
people happy. There, look round this room; you see every
panel hung with a picture, a lyre, or a volume; what does
that tell?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not the habits of a camp; yet he is distinguished
in the field.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Emperor</div>

<p>“No man more. There is not a rider in the legions who can
sit a horse or throw a lance better. He has the talents of a
general besides; and more than all, he has the most iron perseverance
that ever dwelt in man. If the two armies were to
slaughter each other until there was but half a dozen spearmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
left between them, Titus would head his remnant and
fight until he died. But whether it is nature or the poison
that he drank along with Britannicus, he wants the eternal
vividness of his father. Aye, there was the soldier for the
legions. Look, prince, at this picture,<a name="ENanchor_54" id="ENanchor_54"></a><a href="#Endnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and tell me what
you think of the countenance.”</p>

<p>He drew aside a curtain that covered a superb portrait of
the Emperor. I saw a countenance of incomparable shrewdness,
eccentricity, and self-enjoyment. Every feature told the
same tale, from the rounded and dimpled chin to the broad
and deeply veined forehead, overhung with its rough mat of
hair. The hooked nose, the deep wrinkles about the lips, the
thick dark eyebrows, obliquely raised as if some new jest was
gathering, showed the perpetual humorist. But the eye beneath
that brow—an orb black as charcoal, with a spot of intense
brightness in the center, as if a breath could turn that
coal into flame—belonged to the supreme sagacity and determination
that had raised Vespasian from a tent to the throne.</p>

<p>The secretary, whose jovial character strongly resembled
that of the object of his panegyric, could not restrain his admiration.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, “is the man who has fought more battles,
said more good things, and taken less physic than any emperor
that ever wore the diadem. I served with him from
decurion up to tribune, and he was always the same—active,
brave, and laughing from morn to night. Old as he is, day
never finds him in his bed. He rides, swims, runs, outjests
everybody, and frowns at nothing on earth but an old woman
and a physician. He loves money, ’tis true; yet what he
squeezes from the overgrown, he scatters like a prince. But
his mirth is inexhaustible; a little rough, so much for his
camp education; but the most curious mixture of justice,
spleen, and pleasantry in the world.”</p>

<p>My companion’s memory teemed with examples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Emperor’s Traits</div>

<p>“An Alexandrian governor was ordered to Rome to account
for a long course of extortion; immediately on his arrival
he pretended to be taken violently ill, which, of course,
put off the inquiry. The Emperor heard of this, expressed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
greatest interest in so meritorious a public servant, paid him
a visit the next day, disguised as a physician, ordered him a
variety of medicines, which the unfortunate governor was
compelled to take, renewed his visit regularly every day, and
every day charged him an enormous fee! Beggary stared the
governor in the face, and never was a complication of disorders
so rapidly cured!</p>

<p>“I was riding out in his attendance one day a few miles
from Rome when we saw a fellow beating his mule cruelly,
and on being called to, insisted on his right to torture the
animal. I was indignant and would have fought the mule’s
quarrel. But the Emperor laughed at my zeal, and after some
jesting with the brutal owner, bought the mule, only annexing
the condition that the fellow should lead it to the stable;
he actually sent him with the mule two hundred and fifty
miles on foot, to one of his palaces in Gaul, and with a lictor
after him to see that the contract was fairly performed.</p>

<p>“One of his chamberlains had been soliciting a place about
court, for, as he said, his brother. The Emperor found out the
fact that it was for a stranger, who was to lay down a large
sum. He sent for the stranger, ratified the bargain, gave him
the place, and put the money in his own pocket. The chamberlain
was in great alarm on meeting the Emperor some days
after. ‘Your dejection is natural enough,’ said Vespasian, ‘as
you have so lately lost your brother; but, then, you should
wish me joy, for he has become mine!’</p>

<p>“By the altar of Momus and the brass beard of the god
Ridiculous, I could tell you a hundred things of the same
kind,” continued the jovial and inexhaustible secretary; “take
but one more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Betraying Court Secrets</div>

<p>“One of our great patricians, an Æmilian, and as vain
and insolent a beast as lives, had ordered a quantity of a
particular striped cloth, which it cost the merchant infinite
pains to procure. But the great man’s taste had altered in the
mean time, and he returned the cloth without ceremony,
threatening, besides, that if the merchant made any clamors
on the subject, his payment should be six months’ work in the
slave-mill. The man, on the verge of ruin, came, tearing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
hair and bursting with rage, to lay his complaint before the
Emperor, who, however, plainly told him that there was no
remedy, but desired him to send a dress of the same cloth to
the palace. Within the week the patrician was honored with
a message that the Emperor would dine with him, and the
message was accompanied with the dress and an intimation
that Vespasian wished to make it popular. Rome was instantly
ransacked for the cloth, but not a yard of it was to be
found but in the merchant’s hands. The patrician’s household
must be equipped in it, cost what it would. The dealer, in
pleasant revenge, charged ten times the value, and his fortune
was made in a day.</p>

<p>“Now Titus, with many a noble quality, is altogether another
man. He abhors the Emperor’s rough-hewn jocularity;
he speaks Greek better than the Emperor does his own tongue;
is a poet, and a clever one besides, in both languages; extemporizes
verse with elegance; is no mean performer on the lyre;
sings; is a picture-lover, and so forth. I believe from my
soul that, with all his talents for war and government, he
would rather spend his day over books and his evenings among
poets and philosophers, or telling Italian tales to the ears of
some of your brilliant orientals, than ride over the world
at the head of legions. And now,” said my open-hearted
guide, “having betrayed court secrets enough for one day, I
must leave you and return to the camp. Here you will spend
your time as you please until some decision is come to. The
household is at your service, and the officer in command will
attend your orders. Farewell!”</p>

<p>Captivity is wretchedness, even if the captive trod on cloth
of gold. My treatment was imperial; a banquet that might
have feasted a Roman epicure was laid before me; a crowd
of attendants, sumptuously habited, waited round the table;
music played, perfumes burned, and the whole ceremonial of
princely luxury was gone through, as if Titus were present instead
of his heart-broken prisoner. But to that prisoner bread
and water with freedom would have been the truer luxury.</p>

<p>I wandered through the spacious apartments, dazzled by
their splendor and often ready to ask: “Can man be unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
in the midst of these things?” yet answering the question
in the pang of heart which they were so powerless to soothe.
I took down the richly blazoned volumes of the Western
poets, and while at every line that I unrolled, I felt how much
richer were their contents than the gold and gems that encased
them, still I felt the inadequacy of even their beauty and vigor
to console the spirit stricken by real calamity. I strayed to
the crystal casements, through which the sunset had begun to
pour in a tide of glory. The landscape was beautiful—a
peaceful valley, shut in with lofty eminences, on whose marble
foreheads the sunbeams wrought coronets as colored and glittering
as ever were set with chrysolite and ruby. The snow
was gone as rapidly as it had come, and the green earth, in
the freshness of the bright hour, might almost be said “to
laugh and sing.” The air came, laden with the fragrance of
flowers. There was a light and joyous beauty in even the
waving of the shrubs as they shook off the moisture in sparkles
at every wave; birds innumerable broke out into song,
and fluttered their little wet wings with delight in the sunshine;
and the rivulet, still swelled with the snows, ran dimpling
and gurgling along with a music of its own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Alone</div>

<p>But the true sadness of the soul is not to be scattered even
by the loveliness of external things. I turned from the sun
and nature to fling myself on my couch and feel that where
a man’s treasure is, there his heart is also.</p>

<p>“What might not in those hours be doing in Jerusalem?”
mused I; “what fanatic violence, personal revenge, or public
license might not be let loose while I was lingering among the
costly vanities of the pagan? My enemy at least was there
in the possession of unbridled authority”; and the thought
was in itself a history of evil. “And where was Esther, my
beloved, the child of my soul, the glowing and magnificent-minded
being whose beauty and whose thoughts were scarcely
mortal? Might she not be in the last extremity of suffering,
upbraiding me for having forgotten my child; or in the hands
of robbers, dragging her delicate form through rocks and
sands; or dying, without a hand to succor, or a voice to
cheer her in the hour of agony?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>Thought annihilates time, and I had lain one day thus
sinking from depth to depth, I know not how long, until I
was roused by the entrance of the usual endless train of attendants;
and the chief steward, a venerable man of my country,
whom Titus had generously continued in the office where
he found him, came to acquaint me that the banquet awaited
my pleasure. The old man wept at the sight of a chieftain
of Israel in captivity; his heart was full, and when I had dismissed
the attendants with their untasted banquet, he gave
way to his recollections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the Palace
of Ananus</div>

<p>The palace was once the dwelling of Ananus, the high
priest whose death under the cruelest circumstances was the
leading triumph of the factions and the ruin of Jerusalem.
In the very chamber where I sat he had spent the last day of
his life, and left it only to take charge of the Temple on the
fatal night of the assault by the Idumæans. He was wise and
vigorous, but what is the wisdom of man? A storm, memorable
in the annals of devastation, had raged during the night.
Ananus, convinced that all was safe from human hostility in
this ravage of the elements, suffered the wearied citizens to
retire from their posts. The gates were opened by traitors;
the Idumæans, furious for blood and spoil, rushed in; the
guard, surprised in their sleep, were massacred; and by daylight
eight thousand corpses lay on the sacred pavements of
the Temple, and among them the noblest and wisest man of
Judea, Ananus.</p>

<p>“I found,” said the old man, “the body of my great and
good lord under a heap of dead, but was not suffered to convey
it to the tomb of his fathers, in the valley of Jehoshaphat. I
brought his sword and his phylactery here, and they are now
the only memorials of the noblest line that perished since the
Maccabee. In these chambers I have remained since, and in
them it is my hope to die. The palace is large; the Roman
senators and officers reside in another wing, which I have not
entered for years, and shall never enter; mild masters as the
Romans have been to me, I can not bear to see them masters
within the walls of a chief of my country.”</p>

<p>The story of Naomi occurred to me, but she was so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
beyond my hope of discovery that I forbore to renew the old
man’s griefs by her name. A sound of trumpets and the trampling
of cavalry were now heard from the portal.</p>

<p>“It is but the nightly changing of the troops,” said the
steward, “or perhaps the arrival of officers from the camp;
they often ride here after nightfall to supper, spend a few
hours, and by daybreak are gone. But of them and their proceedings
I know nothing. No Jew enters, or desires to enter,
the banquet-hall of the enemies of his country.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Closer
Confinement</div>

<p>A knocking at the door interrupted him, and an officer appeared
with an order for the prisoner in the palace to be removed
into strict confinement. The venerable steward gave
way to tears at the new offense to a leader of his people. I felt
some surprise, but merely asked what new alarm had demanded
this harsh measure.</p>

<p>“I know no more,” replied the officer, “than that the general
has arrived here a few minutes since, and that as some
attempts have been lately made on his life, the council have
thought proper to put the Jewish poniards as much out of his
way as they can. The order is universal, and I am directed to
lead you to your apartment.”</p>

<p>“Then let them look to my escape,” said I; “I thank the
council for this service. While I continued above suspicion,
they might have thrown open every door in their dungeons.
But since they thus degrade me, you may tell them that their
walls should be high and their bolts strong to keep me their
prisoner. Lead on, sir.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s New Quarters</div>

<p>The council seemed to have been aware of my opinion, for
my new chamber was in one of the turrets. The lower floor
being occupied by the guard, there could be no undermining;
the smallness of the building laid all the operations of the
fugitive open to the sentinel’s eye, and the height was of
itself an obstacle that, even if the bars were forced, might
daunt the adventurer. The steward followed me to my den,
wringing his hands. Yet the little apartment was not incommodious;
there were some obvious attempts at rendering it a
fitter place of habitation than usual, and a more delicate frame
than mine might have found indulgence in its carpets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
cushions. Even my solitary hours were not forgotten, and
some handsome volumes from the governor’s library occupied
a corner. There was a lyre, too, if I chose to sing my sorrows,
and a gilded chest of wine if I chose to drink them
away. The height was an inconvenience only to my escape,
but a lover of landscape and fresh air would have envied me,
for I had the range of the horizon and the benefit of every
breeze from its four quarters. A Chaldee would have chosen
it for his commerce with the lights of heaven, for every star,
from the gorgeous front of Aldebaran to the minutest diamond
spark of the sky, shone there in all its brightness. And a
philosopher would have rejoiced in the secluded comfort of
a spot which, in the officer’s parting pleasantry, was in every
sense “so much above the world.”</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXI">CHAPTER LXI<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>A Steward’s Narrative</i></span></h3>

<p>To me, the prison and the palace were the same. No believer
in fate, and a strong believer in the doctrine that in the
infinite majority of cases the unlucky have to thank only
themselves, I was yet irresistibly conscious of my own stern
exception. That there was an influence hanging over me I
deeply knew; that I might as well strive with the winds was
the fruit of my whole experience; and with the loftiest calculation
of the wonders that human energy may work, I abandoned
myself on principle to the chances of the hour. I was
the weed upon the wave, and whether above or below the
surface, I knew that the wave would roll on, and that I must
roll on along with it. I was the atom in the air, and whether
I should float unseen forever or be brought into sight by the
gilding of some chance sunbeam, my destiny was to float and
quiver up and down. I was the vapor, and whether, like the
evening cloud, my after-years were to evolve into glorious
shapes and colors, or I should creep along the pools and valleys
of fortune till the end of time—yet there I was, still in
existence, and that existence bound by laws incapable of the
choice or the caprices of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Burden</div>

<p>I had yet to learn the true burden of my great malediction,
for the circumstances of my life were adverse to its fated solitude
of soul; its bitter conviction that there was not a being
under the canopy of heaven whose heart was toward me. I
was still in the very tumult of life and battling with the boldest.
Public cares, personal interests, glowing attachments,
the whole vigorous activity of the citizen and the soldier
were mine. I was still husband, father, friend, and champion;
my task was difficult and grave, but it was ardent, proud, and
animating. I was made for this energy of the whole man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
master of a powerful frame that defied fatigue, and was proof
against the sharpest visitations of nature; and of an intellect
which, whatever might be its rank, rejoiced in tasking itself
with labors that appalled the multitude.</p>

<p>Idle as I knew the praise of man, and sovereign as was my
scorn for the meanness which stoops to the vulgar purchase
of popularity, I felt and honored the true fame—that renown
whose statue is devoted, not by suspicious and clamorous flattery
of the time, but by the solemn and voluntary homage of
the future, whose splendor, like that of a new-born star, if it
take ages to reach mankind, is sure to reach them at last, and
shines for ages after its fount is extinguished; whose essential
power, if it be coerced and obscured, like that of a man while
his earthly tenement still shuts him in, is thenceforth to develop
itself from strength to strength—the mortal putting on
immortality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fetters of
a Soul</div>

<p>In the whirl of such thoughts I was often carried away, to
the utter oblivion of my peculiar fate, for the man and his associations
were strong within me, in defiance of the command.
The gloom often passed away from my soul, as the darkness
does from the midnight ocean in the dash and foam of its own
waters. Nature is perpetual and drives the affections, sleeping
or waking, as it drives the blood through the old channels.
It was only at periods, produced by strong circumstance, that
I felt the fetter, but then the iron entered into my soul! To
this partial pressure belongs the singular combination of such
a fate as mine with an interest in the world, with my loves
and hates, my thirst of human fame, my reluctance at the
prospect of the common ills and injuries of life. I was a man,
and this is the whole solution of the problem. For one remote
evidence that I was distinct from mankind, I had ten thousand,
direct and constant, that I was the same. But for the
partiality of the pressure there was a lofty reason.</p>

<p>The man who feels himself above the common fate is instantly
placed above the common defenses of mankind. He
may calumniate and ruin; he may burn and plunder; he may
be the rebel and the murderer. Fear is, after all, the great
defense. But what earthly power could intimidate him?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
What were chains or the scaffold to him who felt instinctively
that time was not made for his being; that the scaffold was
impotent; that he should yet trample on the grave of his
judge, on the moldered throne of his king, on the dead
sovereignty of his nation? With his impassiveness, his
experience, his knowledge, and his passions, concocted and
blackened by ages, what breast could be safe against the dagger
of this tremendous exile? What power be secure against
the rebel machination or the open hostility of a being invested
with the strength of immortal evil? What was to hinder a
man made familiar with every mode of influencing human
passions—the sage, the sorcerer, the fount of tradition, the
friend of their worshiped ancestors—from maddening the
multitude at whose head he willed to march, clothed in the
attributes of almost a divinity?</p>

<p>But I was precluded or saved from this fearful career by
the providential feeling of the common repugnances, hopes,
and fears of human nature. Pain and disease were instinctively
as much shunned by me as if I held my life on the
frailest tenure; death was as formidable as my natural soldiership
would suffer it to be; and even when the thought occurred
that I might defy extinction, it threw but a darker
shade over the common terrors, to conceive that I must undergo
the suffering of death without the peace of the grave.
Man bears his agony for once, and it is done. Mine might be
borne to the bitterest extremity, but must be borne with the
keener bitterness of the knowledge that it was in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Message
from Septimius</div>

<p>I was recalled from those reveries to the world by a paper
dropped through a crevice in the rafters above my head. On
seeing its signature, “Septimius,” my first impulse was to tear
it in pieces, but Esther’s name struck me, and I read it through.</p>

<p>“You must not think me a villain, tho I confess appearances
are much in favor of the supposition. But I had no
choice between denying that I knew you and being instantly
beheaded. This comes of discipline. Titus is a disciplinarian
of the first order, and the consequence is that no man dares
acknowledge any little irregularity before him: so far, his
morality propagates knaves. But I must clear myself of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
charge of having acted disingenuously by your daughter. I
take every power that binds the soul to witness that I know
not what is become of her; nay, I am in the deepest anxiety
to know the fate of one so lovely, so innocent, and so high-minded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lover’s
Confession</div>

<p>“And now, prince, that I am out of the reach of your
frown, let me have courage to disburden my heart. I have
long known Esther, and as long loved her. From the time
when I was first received within your palace in Naphtali—and
I have not forgotten that to your hospitality I then owed
my life—I was struck with her talents and her beauty. When
the war separated us and I returned to Rome, neither in
Rome nor in the empire could I see her equal. To solicit our
union I gave up the honors and pleasures of the court for the
campaign in your hazardous country. I searched Judea in
vain, and it was chiefly in the vague hope of obtaining some
intelligence of Esther that I solicited the command of our unfortunate
mission. There I felt all hazard more than repaid
by her sight, to me lovelier than ever. I will acknowledge
that I prolonged my confinement to have the opportunity of
obtaining her hand. But her religious scruples were unconquerable.
I implored her leave to explain myself to you.
Even this, too, she refused, ‘from her knowledge of your decision.’
What then was I to do? Loving to excess, bewildered
by passion, oppressed with disappointment, and seeing
but one object on earth, my evil genius prompted me to act
the dissembler.</p>

<p>“Under pretext of disclosing some secrets connected with
your safety I induced her to meet me, for the first and the
last time, on the battlements. There I besought her to fly
with me—to be my bride—to enjoy the illustrious rank and
life that belonged to the imperial blood; and when we were
once wedded, to solicit the approval of her family. I was sincere;
I take the gods to witness I was sincere. But my entreaty
was in vain; she repelled me with resolute scorn; she
charged me with treachery to you, to her, to faith, and to
sacred hospitality. I knelt to her—she spurned me. In distraction,
and knowing only that to live without her was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
wretchedness, I was bearing her away to the gate when we
were surrounded by armed men. My single attendant fled; I
was overpowered, and I saw Esther, my lovely and beloved
Esther, no more.”</p>

<p>There was an honesty in this full confession that did more
for the writer’s cause than subtler language. The young
Roman had been severely tried, and who could expect from a
soldier the self-denial that it might have been hard to find
under the brow of philosophy? Stern as time and trial had
made me, I was not petrified into a contempt for the generous
weaknesses of earlier years; and to love a being like Esther—what
was it but to be just? While I honored the high sense
of duty which repelled a lover so dangerous to a woman’s
heart, I pitied and forgave the violence of a passion lighted
by unrivaled loveliness of form and mind.</p>

<p>It was growing late, and the steward, who made a virtue of
showing me the more respect the more I was treated with
severity, came in to arrange my couch for the night; he would
suffer no inferior hands to approach the person of one of the
leaders of his fallen country.</p>

<p>“In truth,” said he, “if I were not permitted to be your
attendant to-night, my prince might have been forgotten, for
every human being but myself is busy in the banquet-gallery.”</p>

<p>Sounds of instruments and voices arose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Titus Gives a
Banquet</div>

<p>“There,” said he, “you may hear the music. Titus gives a
supper in honor of the Emperor’s birthday, and the palace will
be kept awake until daylight, for the Romans, with all their
gravity, are great lovers of the table, and Titus is renowned
for late sittings. Would you wish to see the banquet?”</p>

<p>So saying, he unbarred the shutters of a casement, commanding
a view along the gallery, of which every door and
window was thrown open for the breeze.</p>

<p>If an ancient Roman could start from his slumber into the
midst of European life, he must look with scorn on its absence
of grace, elegance, and fancy. But it is in its festivities,
and most of all in its banquets, that he would feel the incurable
barbarism of the Gothic blood. Contrasted with the fine
displays that made the table of the Roman noble a picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
and threw over the indulgence of appetite the colors of the
imagination, with what eyes must he contemplate the tasteless
and commonplace dress, the coarse attendants, the meager
ornament, the want of mirth, music, and intellectual interest—the
whole heavy machinery that converts the feast into the
mere drudgery of devouring!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Views
the Scene</div>

<p>The guests before me were fifty or sixty splendidly attired
men, attended by a crowd of domestics equipped with scarcely
less splendor, for no man thought of coming to the banquet in
the robes of ordinary life. The embroidered couch, itself a
striking object, allowed the ease of position, at once delightful
in the relaxing climates of the south and capable of combining
with every grace of the human figure. At a slight distance
the table, loaded with plate, glittering under a profusion of
lamps and surrounded by couches covered with rich draperies,
was like a central source of light radiating in broad shafts of
every brilliant hue. All that belonged to the ornament of the
board was superb. The wealth of the patricians and their
perpetual intercourse with Greece made them masters of the
finest performances of the arts. The sums expended on plate
were enormous, but its taste and beauty were essential to the
refined enjoyment of the banquet. Copies of the most famous
statues and groups of sculpture in the precious metals, exquisite
trophies of Greek and Roman victory, models of the
celebrated temples, mingled with vases of flowers and burning
perfumes; and covering and coloring all was a vast scarlet
canopy, which combined the groups beneath the eye, and
threw the whole scene into the light that a painter would love.</p>

<p>But yet finer skill was shown in the constant prevention of
that want of topic which turns conversation into weariness.
There was a rapid succession of new excitements. Even the
common changes of the table were made to assist this purpose.
The entrance of each course was announced by music,
and the attendants were preceded by a procession of minstrels,
chaplet-crowned, and playing Grecian melodies. Between the
courses a still higher entertainment was offered in the recitations,
dramas, and pleasantries, read or acted by a class of
professional satirists, of the absurdities of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amusements
of a
Feast</div>

<p>It is easy to imagine how fertile a source of interest this
must have been made by the subtle and splenetic Italian
moving through Roman life; the most various, animating, and
fantastic scene in which society ever shone. The recitations
were always looked to as the charm of the feast. They were
often severe, but their severity was reserved for public men
and matters. The court supplied the most tempting and popular
ridicule, but the reciter was a privileged person, and all
the better-humored Cæsars bore the castigation without a
murmur. No man in the empire was more laughed at than
Vespasian, and no man oftener joined in the laugh.</p>

<p>One of this morning’s sports was to collect the burlesques
of the night before, give them new pungency by a touch of
the imperial pen, and then despatch them to make their way
through the world. The strong-headed sovereign knew the
value of an organ of public opinion, and used to call their
perusal, “sitting for his picture.” The picture was sometimes
so strong that the courtiers trembled. But the veteran, who
had borne thirty years of battle, laid it up among “his portraits,”
laughed the insult away, and repeated his popular
saying, “that when he was old enough to come to years of
discretion and give up the emperor, he should become reciter
himself and have his turn with the world.”</p>

<p>The recitations again were varied by a sportive lottery, in
which the guests drew prizes—sometimes of value, gems and
plate—sometimes merely an epigram, or a caricature. The
banquet generally closed with a theatric dance by the chief
public performers of the day, and the finest forms and the
most delicate art of Greece and Ionia displayed the story of
Theseus and Ariadne, the flight of Jason, the fate of Semele,
or some other of their brilliant fictions. In the presence of
this vivid display sat, tempering its sportiveness by the majesty
of religion, the three great tutelar idols of Rome—Jove,
Juno, and Minerva, of colossal height, throned at the head of
the hall; completing, false as they were, the most singular
and dazzling combination that man ever saw, of the delight of
the senses with the delight of the mind.</p>

<p>To me human delight was always a source of enjoyment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
and in the sounds of the harps and flutes and the pleasant
murmur of cheerful voices I was not unwilling to forget the
spot from which I listened. But the prisoner can not long forget
his cell, and closing the casement I walked away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Steward
Tells of
Matthan</div>

<p>“Little I ever thought,” sighed the old steward, “of seeing
that sight. But all nations have fallen in their time, and perhaps
the only wonder is that Israel should have stood so long.
It is still stranger to my eyes to see that gallery as it is to-night.
It is fifteen years this very day since I saw the light
of lamp or the foot of man within those casements.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” said I, “the great Ananus lived as became his rank,
and there were then no dangers to disturb him in the midst of
his people.”</p>

<p>“But there was one terrible event which made those walls
unhallowed; nay, even in this spot I would not remain alone
through the night to have the palace for my own.”</p>

<p>A rich strain of music that ushered in some change in the
displays of the banquet interrupted my question, while the
old man’s countenance assumed something of the alarm which
he described.</p>

<p>“That sound,” said he, shuddering, “goes to my heart. It
is the same that I heard on the night of death. On that night
Matthan, the only son of my great master, was to be wedded
to the daughter of the prince of Hebron, and that gallery was
laid out for the wedding-feast. All the leaders of Jerusalem
were there, all the noble women, all the chief priesthood; all
the grandeur, wealth, and beauty of our tribe. But Matthan
was not the son of his father’s mind. He had fled from his
father’s roof years before, and taken refuge in the mountains.
The caravan passing through Galilee dreaded the name of
Matthan, for he was bold; the chief of the hills saw his followers
flying from his side, for deadly was the spear of Matthan;
but he was generous, and often the slave rejoiced in the
breaking of his chains, and the peasant saw his flocks cover
the valley again by the arm and the bounty of Matthan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Countenance of Wrath and Wo</div>

<p>“I saw him on the day when he returned; danger or sorrow
had wrought a change in him like the passing from youth
to age. His strength was gone, and his voice was broken, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
the voice of him that treads on the brink of the timely grave.
His noble father wept over him, but gave him welcome; and
the palace was filled with rejoicing for the coming back of the
first-born. Yet he took no delight in the feast, neither in the
praises of men nor in the voice of the singer. He wandered
through his father’s halls, even as the leopard, chained and
longing to escape to the desert and the prey again. Disturbances
were beginning to be heard in Jerusalem, and he fell
into the hands of the evil one. Onias, the man of blood, betrayed
him into the secret ways of conspiracy against our
conquerors. His heart was bold and his temper high, and he
was easily drawn into the desperate game by a villain who
stirred up the generous spirit of our nobles, only to sell their
blood to Rome.</p>

<p>“He grew more lonely day by day; withdrew from the
amusements of his rank, and shut himself up in the wing of
the palace, ending in this tower. In this room I have seen his
lamp burning through the livelong winter nights, and grieved
over the sleeplessness that showed he was among the unhappy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Strangeness of a Bridegroom</div>

<p>“At last a change was wrought upon him. He went forth;
he took delight in the horse and the chariot, in the chase,
and the feast, and the die. His father, that he might bless
his posterity before he died, counseled him to take to wife
Thamar, the noblest of the daughters of Hebron. The day of
the marriage was appointed. On that day I saw him come
from the council-hall, after receiving the congratulations of
his friends. I saw him passing along to his chamber, but I
dared not cross him on his way. He thought that he was
alone, and then he gave way to his agony. Never did I behold
such a countenance of wrath and wo. It was bloated
with prodigal living, and it was now flushed with wine. He
raved, he rent his bridal raiment and cast it from him; he
wept; he knelt and cursed the hour he was born. I remained
in my refuge, yet more in fear of his countenance than of his
sword. He took letters from his bosom, read them, and then
scattered their fragments in the air. He tottered toward me,
and I dreaded his rage, but I saw at a glance that his mind
was gone. He was talking to the air; he clasped his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
wildly; his face was covered with tears; he implored for
mercy, and fell. I hastened to bear him to a couch; he saw
me not, but cried out against himself as a betrayer and a murderer,
the fugitive from honor, the criminal marked by the
hand of Heaven.</p>

<p>“I called for help. His mountaineers rushed in; they repulsed
me; and chiding him in their barbarian tongue, and
seeming accustomed to those fits of sorrow, carried away in
their arms the noble Matthan, crying like a child.</p>

<p>“The evening fell, and I saw him ride forth at the head of
his kindred to bring home the bride. The wretchedness of the
day had passed, and those who looked only on the lofty bearing
and heard the joyous language of the leader of that train
would have thought that sorrow had never touched his heart.
I watched for his return with anxiety, for I deemed him unhallowed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Coming of a Bride</div>

<p>“But all was well; the bridal train returned. Matthan,
glittering in jewels, came proudly, reining a steed white as
the snow. The harp and trumpet, the chorus of the singers,
the light of the torches, and the glitter of the youths and
maidens who danced before the bride made me forget everything
but the joy of seeing peace among us once more. But
at the banquet the wonder of all was the bridegroom himself.
Loud as the guests’ voices were, his voice was the loudest;
he laughed at everything, as if he had never known a care in
the world, or was never to know one again. The jest was
never out of his lips; and when he pledged the cup to the
health of the company or the fair bride—and often he pledged
it that evening—he always said something that raised shouts
of applause. I once or twice passed near him, but he had
wiped every sign of grief from his features, and if he seemed
to be mad with anything, it was with joy. The gallery rang
with admiration, and not less with surprise, for he had shut
himself up so long from the people that he was almost unknown,
and the world is generally good-natured enough to invent
a character for those who will take no trouble to make
one for themselves. Some had set him down for intolerable
haughtiness; others for fear of mixing in the growing tumults;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
others for a dealer in the black arts; and still others for a
mere fool. But now opinions were altered, and every voice of
his tribe was loud in wonder at the talents he had so long hid
in retirement.</p>

<p>“I was standing in the train of the High Priest, near the
central casement, through which you may now see the throne
of Titus. My eyes, I know not why, strayed to this tower; I
marked a feeble lamp, a form rushing backward and forward
in gestures of violent sorrow. A foot beside me made me turn.
There stood Matthan with his eyes fixed upon the tower. But
his mind was gone. He looked like a man stricken into stone.
He saw me not; he saw not the guests; he saw nothing but
the feeble lamp, the hurrying form.</p>

<p>“The chorus of the singing women announced that the
bride was about to come. I looked up at the tower; the lamp
was twinkling its last, and the form was still seen wringing
its hands. The hymn began that denotes the veiling of the
bride; but my eyes were fixed on the dying light and the
form, which now held a cup in its hand. A shriek was heard,
so wild that the guests sprang from their seats in alarm and
astonishment. My eye turned upon Matthan, but he had
summoned up his strength, and tho I saw him shake in every
limb, his proud lip wore a smile.</p>

<p>“Clasping his hand upon his brow, he abruptly turned from
the window and demanded why the bridal attendants delayed
the coming of the princess of Hebron. The lamp had now
disappeared, and the tower was in darkness again. The portals
were at length thrown open and the bride was led up to
the canopy beneath which the bridegroom stood. He raised
the veil. His countenance was instantly transformed into
horror. He uttered no cry, but stood gazing. The bride let
fall the veil again, and taking his hand, led him slowly and
without a word down the hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Matthan’s Death</div>

<p>“None checked this strange ceremony; none dared to check
it. We were deprived of all power by astonishment. The
High Priest himself stood with his venerable hands lifted up
to heaven, as if he felt that evil was come upon his house.
The wedded pair walked in silence through the long range of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
chambers to the tower, and as they passed, the numberless attendants
felt themselves bound by mysterious awe. But our
senses at length returned, and Ananus, in the full dread of
misfortune, yet bold to his dying hour, suffered none to go
before him. We found the door of the tower barred, and long
summoned Matthan to come forth and relieve our fears lest
some desperate invention of sorcery had been played upon
him. No answer was returned, and we forced the door.</p>

<p>“What a sight was there! Two corpses lay side by side.
The blood still trickled from the bosom of the unfortunate
Matthan. I raised the veil of the bride; the hue of poison
was upon the lips, but they were not the lips of the princess
of Hebron. The countenance was Arabian, and of exceeding
beauty, but wan and wasted by sorrow.”</p>

<p>“Who, then, was his strange companion in the hall?” I
asked.</p>

<p>The answer was given with a shudder. “I know not, but it
seemed scarcely a being of this world. A new confusion
arose. The mountaineers, on hearing of the death of their
lord and still more of that noble creature in whom they honored
the race of their chieftains, demanded vengeance: they
were too fierce to listen to reason, and our attempts to explain
the unhappy truth only kindled their rage. Simitars
were drawn, blood was shed, and tho the barbarians were
repelled, yet they plundered the wing of the palace and bore
off the infant offspring of their dead mistress, the last scion
of an illustrious tree that was itself so soon to feel the ax.</p>

<p>“I saw the unfortunate and guilty Matthan laid in the sepulcher
of his fathers—the last that ever slept there, for his
great sire, worthy of being laid in the monument of kings,
was denied the honors of the grave by his murderers. Yet
he sleeps in the noblest of all graves; his memory is treasured
in the love and sorrows of his country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arabian Stranger</div>

<p>“It was discovered that Matthan, during his wanderings in
the desert, had wedded the daughter of a sheik. He loved
her with the violence of his nature, but the prospects which
opened to him on his return to his country made him shrink
from the acknowledgment of his Arabian bride. Yet to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
without her he found impossible, and he brought her to the
tower. Surrounded by his mountaineers, this portion of the
palace was inaccessible. His solitude and the lights seen
through the casements were often thought to imply studies of
the strange philosophy or evil superstitions that had begun to
infect the noble youth of Palestine.</p>

<p>“But the necessity of sustaining his ambition by an illustrious
marriage drove his fickle heart at last to treachery. The
Arabian knew the intended marriage, and pined away before
his eyes. Remorse and ambition alternately distracted him.
The bridal procession was seen by the unhappy wife, and she
swallowed poison. The rest is beyond my power to account
for. But it is rumored among the attendants that strange
sights have since been seen and sounds of a bridal throng
heard in the chambers through which their last melancholy
procession was made; tho, whether it be truth or the common
fear of the peasantry, I know not, nor indeed wish too
curiously to inquire.”</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXII">CHAPTER LXII<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>A Prisoner in the Tower</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion
among Guests</div>

<p>As the old man spoke, sounds arose not unsuited to his
tale. But my faith in the legend did not amount to so sudden
a realization, and I looked toward the banquet. There, from
whatever motive, everything was in sudden disturbance. The
guests were hurrying from the tables. Many had thrown the
military cloak over their festal robes; some were in the adjoining
apartments hastily equipping themselves with arms
and armor. A group was standing round Titus, evidently in
anxious consultation. In the spacious grounds below, horsemen
were mounting and attendants hurrying in all directions.
The calls of the clarion echoed through the courts; shortly
after a large body of cavalry came wheeling round to the
portal of the gardens, and Titus went forth, conspicuous
among the bustling crowd for his manly composure. He gave
some orders which were despatched by tribunes galloping as
for their lives; then mounting his charger, rode slowly through
the gates at the head of his stately company, himself the most
stately of them all.</p>

<p>The woods surrounding the palace soon intercepted the
view of the imperial troop; and after straining my eyes as
long as I could see the glitter of a helmet by the waning
moon, I turned to my casement to make that prayer for the
peace of Jerusalem which had been nightly on my lips from
the hour when they first could pronounce the name. From
the dungeon has that supplication risen; from the mine; from
the sands of the wilderness; from the shores of the farthest
ocean; from the bosom of the rolling waters; from the fires
of the persecutor; from the field before the battle; from the
field covered with its dead; from the living grave of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
monk; from the cavern of the robber; from the palace; even
from the scaffold!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Red
Illumination</div>

<p>While I continued in this outpouring of the soul, with my
eyes fixed on the cloudy world above, a pale reflection spread
over the masses of rolling vapor; it lingered, faded, and night
covered the earth; suddenly a fierce luster turned the low and
heavy clouds into the color of conflagration.</p>

<p>“There is an attack on either the enemy’s camp or the
city,” I exclaimed to my companion. “Daybreak it can not be,
for the middle watch has not been half an hour sounded. Help
me to escape; be but my guide through the chambers, and
name your recompense.”</p>

<p>The steward wrung his helpless hands, and offered his life
to my service, but described the precautions of my jailers so
fully that I gave up the idea. Still I was tossed by anxious
thoughts. I heard the treading of the guard until its recurrence
irritated me. The moanings of the wind through the
trees told that a storm was rising, and to get rid of the uneasy
conflict between the desire of sleep and the difficulty of
shutting out thought, I rose and watched the progress of the
tempest.</p>

<p>The lightnings flashed in broad beams through the clouds,
and the rain fell with the violence of the southern storm.
But through the flash, deepening again, shone the red illumination
above the city, and neither the roar of the wind nor the
dash of the descending deluge could extinguish the shouts
that, remote as they were, I knew to be shouts of battle. I
measured the tower with my eye; I tried the strength of the
bars; but the attempt only served to disturb my companion,
who had survived his sorrows long enough to sleep as soundly
as if there were not a wo on earth.</p>

<p>“I am glad,” said he, “that you awoke me, for I was
dreaming the story of my unfortunate lord and his son over
again.”</p>

<p>“The natural result of your having so lately renewed its
recollection.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Figure in the Gallery</div>

<p>“Aye, there is perhaps scarcely a room under the palace
roof where some heart is not trembling to-night with ghostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
fear, nor a peasant’s thatch where the death of Matthan and
the Arabian has not made pale faces; and where men tell of
the bridegroom stricken in his hour of pride. But—— powers
of Heaven preserve us! look there!”</p>

<p>I looked, but it was to the old man, whose countenance
alarmed me with the idea that he had wrought his imagination
to a hazardous extreme. I took his cold hand, and telling
him that I felt unable to sleep, gently laid his stiffened
limbs on the couch and bade him try to rest. But his eye
stared through the casement till I followed its direction, yet
with only the added belief that he was overcome by the common
terrors of the household; for to me tenfold darkness lay
upon every object from the ground to the battlements.</p>

<p>I accidentally glanced at the gallery, and there I saw a
figure, slight and shadowy, passing backward and forward in
front of a quivering lamp! My surprise was more startling
than I would venture to communicate to my companion, already
almost paralyzed with fear. But if I had conjured up a
phantom to give force to the tale, none could have been more
closely similar. The figure was enveloped in robes whose
richness I could perceive even across the court; the gestures,
the wild hurry of the pacings through the chamber, the general
air of wo and distraction, were not to be mistaken. In
the midst of the silence I heard the creaking of bolts and the
fall of chains that seemed to be at my side. A single word
followed, but that word was terribly comprehensive—“Death!”
The sound was uttered in a sepulchral tone, that left the imagination
free to shape the picture with what sullenness it willed!</p>

<p>But the sound was scarcely uttered when I heard a shriek,
wild as ever told of wo; saw the figure sink down, and the
lamp quiver and expire! The old man had seen what I had
seen, but the natural feebleness of age left him a mere helpless
prey to superstitious fear, and no attempt to explain
these singular coincidences could calm him. He was convinced
that the vengeance that had stricken his master’s house
was still abroad, and that he had beheld its minister. Remonstrance
was in vain, and he sank alternately into reveries
and the stupefaction of spiritual terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Naomi, the
Specter</div>

<p>I tended him with the more interest from my being not
altogether unimpressed with the possibility that his alarms
were just. I was no believer in the vulgar narratives of
superstition. But nature has her mysteries!</p>

<p>While I sat beside the couch and watched the ebb and flow
of life in a frame that I sometimes expected to see utterly
give way, a jarring of bolts again struck my ear. I listened
with a strange emotion. The old man had heard it, and in a
new convulsion grasped both my hands and held me close.
The sound returned; it increased; I saw the wall of the
tower open and the figure stand before me.</p>

<p>“It is she; it is she!” shudderingly murmured my companion,
fixing his eyes on it and holding me with the clasp of
agony.</p>

<p>The heart beat loud within me; but I interposed myself between
the corpse-like being whom I held in my arms and the
unearthly visitant, and demanded “for what purpose it had
come.” The figure started as I spoke; then gazing intently
on me as I turned to the light, threw the mantle from its forehead
and fell at my feet. The lovely Naomi was the specter!
Yet perfectly guiltless of the ghostly potency of her presence
and the unfilial alarm into which she had thrown her
adopted father, whom she was delighted to find, but whom
she candidly acknowledged “she never dreamed of finding
there.”</p>

<p>“The tower contains a prisoner,” said she tremblingly,
“who must be saved this night, for to-morrow at daybreak is
his dreadful hour. I knew that he would be condemned, and
we agreed on a signal, by which I was to learn when the time
was fixed. I have watched all night for it, and almost betrayed
myself by a cry of horror that I could not suppress at
the sight of that signal just now. I had no resource but to
bear my own message, and assist him myself in escaping from
this place of sorrow.”</p>

<p>“But, my child, who is the prisoner, or where is he?”</p>

<p>She blushed and said: “One who saved me when the world
was against me. He rescued me from the hands of barbarians—and
could I leave him to perish?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Finds
a Prisoner</div>

<p>“Lead on then, and without delay, for daybreak is not far.
But how shall we find our way to his dungeon?”</p>

<p>“I paid high,” said she, “for my knowledge of this tower,
and it has no concealments from me. Remove this bar.”</p>

<p>I drew out a slender iron rod; a door deep in the wall gave
way and disclosed a winding stair, by which we descended.
We found the prisoner writing, and so earnestly occupied that
our footsteps did not interrupt him.</p>

<p>“There,” soliloquized he as he ran his eye down the epistle.
“I think, my masters if not the better, some of you will be
the wiser for my labors. Home truths are the truths, after
all. Titus will learn what a set of incurable reprobates he
has about him, and by this time to-morrow, when I shall care
as little for mankind as mankind ever cared for me, I shall
do the state service; from my gibbet turn reformer and make
the scaffold popular. And now, for the farewell to my lady
and my love.”</p>

<p>He sighed and threw down the pen.</p>

<p>“No, my Naomi, I can say nothing half so fond or half so
bitter as my feelings would have me say at this moment.
Would that I had never seen you, if we are to part so soon.
Yet why should I regret to have known innocence and beauty
in their perfection? No, my love, rosy was the hour when I
first saw you, and proud is even the parting hour that tells me
I could have loved so noble a being—but all is better as it is.
How could I have borne to see you following the fortunes of
a wanderer, of a man without a country or a name? Then
farewell, my Naomi dearest, farewell; you were the gleam of
sunshine in my cloudy day, the star in my dreary night, and
while my heart beats you shall be there. Your name shall be
the last upon my lips, and if there be thought beyond the
grave, you shall be remembered, and—oh, how deeply—loved!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arab Captain Recognized</div>

<p>I had been on the point of disturbing his meditation, but
Naomi, with the fine avarice of passion, would not lose a syllable.
She held me back, and implored me by her countenance
to let her have the full confession of her lover’s faith. That
beautiful countenance ran through all the shades of feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
and was covered with blushes and tears while the unconscious
worshiper poured out his devotion. But the time was flying; I
insisted on interrupting this epicureanism of the soul; and when
Naomi found that she must hear no more, she would allow
none but herself the pleasure of the surprise. A sigh which
swelled from the prisoner’s heart was echoed. He turned
suddenly, and pronounced her name with a loudness of delight
that nothing but the chance that protects the imprudent could
have prevented from bringing the guard upon us. His quick
eye soon caught me where I stood in shadow, and he sprang
forward to overpower the intruder. But the lamp saved us
from the encounter, and lifting his hands and eyes in amazement,
he laughed as loudly as he had spoken.</p>

<p>“In the name of all the wonders of the world,” exclaimed
he, “are you here too? Where are we to meet next? We
have met already in water, fire, and earth, and nothing is left
for us now but the clouds. Come, be honest, prince, and tell
me whether it was not for the sake of some such experiment
that you ventured here; for if another hour finds us within
these four walls, we shall know the grand secret as assuredly
as Titus wears a head and has a traitor at his elbow.”</p>

<p>It was the Arab captain! I was rejoiced to find that in attempting
to save the life of Naomi’s lover, I was discharging
a debt to the preserver of my own. To my mention of this
service he replied with soldierlike frankness that “I owed
him no obligation whatever; he had long hated the intolerable
cruelty of Cestius, and the debt was on his side, as I had
indulged him with an opportunity that every officer in the
service would have been happy to use.”</p>

<p>Naomi hung upon me, pale, and anxiously listening to every
sound abroad.</p>

<p>“This little trembler,” said he sportively, as he took her
passive hand, “I am destined to meet always in alarm. I first
found her flying from a troop of human brutes who were robbing
the baggage of the Roman camp; I thought her worth
something better than to keep goats on the Libanus and weave
turbans for some Syrian deserter; she was of the same opinion,
and fell in love with me on the spot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts to
Escape</div>

<p>Naomi exclaimed against this version of the story.</p>

<p>“No matter for the mode,” said he; “I give the facts. I
dazzled her ambition by the promise of a palace—in the air;
bribed her avarice by the display of a purse unconscious of
gold; and bewitched her senses by a speech, a smile, and a
figure that for the first time in my life I found to be irresistible.”</p>

<p>Naomi again protested, and the dialog might have consumed
half the night without their discovering the lapse of
time, had I not interposed and inquired what further means of
escape were in our power. The lovely girl started from her
waking dream and pointed to a ring in the wall. I tried it,
but it resisted my force. At length we all strove at it together.
But no door opened. Naomi wrung her hands.</p>

<p>“The unfortunate lord of this tower in former times,” said
she, and the tears stood in her eyes, “always predicted that it
would be fatal to his family. To escape his own fate, he
pierced its walls with passages in every direction, but they
did not save my noble, my unfortunate father.”</p>

<p>She sat down weeping while I tore at the ring, which finally
broke off in my hands. The lover stood with folded arms,
gazing in sad delight on the beautiful being from whom he
was so soon to part forever, and whose face and form wore
almost the shadowy loveliness of a vision.</p>

<p>The chance of their escape now devolved on me solely, for
neither would have desired to disturb that strange and melancholy
luxury of contemplation. But as the concealed door
must be given up, the only resource was to return to my cell
and thence make our way through the passage by which
Naomi had arrived. A glance from the casement showed
me the court filled with soldiery and lights moving through
the palace. This hope was gone!</p>

<p>In the deepest doubt and fear I ventured up through the
tower to discover whether my cell was not already in possession
of the guard. I pushed back the door noiselessly; the
cell was empty; even the old steward was gone. Imagination
is a dangerous auxiliary in such a crisis, and it created out of
this trivial change a host of alarms. He must have fled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
give notice of my retreat, or to rouse the vigilance of the soldiery
by the stories of the wonders that he had seen. Escape
was hopeless. I even heard a confused whispering, which
proved that we had fallen into the snare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel Discovers
a Door</div>

<p>There was now no alternative but to be seized and die, or to
make a bold rush for life and take our chances. I carried
the fainting Naomi up the stairs; and suppressing the infinite
risk of the attempt to penetrate through a building in which
its inmates were still awake and busy, and which was guarded
by the vigilance of Roman patrols, I advised that we should
do anything rather than remain where we were. She was
timid and submissive; but to my surprise the bold seaman,
the haughty leader of men, harder to be ruled than the elements,
the gallant despiser of death but a day past, was now
totally unnerved. The novelty of passion absorbed the spirit
of the man; he lingered near his mistress, and gazed on her
with an intenseness that told his world was there. To my
questions he gave no answer, but obeyed without a word, or
a glance turned from the exquisite countenance that sank and
blushed under his gaze. If the actual power of enchantment
had been wrought upon him, he could not have been more
fixed, helpless, and charmed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naomi Causes Consternation</div>

<p>I heard the voice of pain, and thought of the ancient follower
of the house of Ananus. My cooler judgment had acquitted
him of betraying me into the enemy’s hands. A part
of the cell was filled up with remnants of a canopy removed
from the statelier apartments. The groan came from behind
them. I flung them away, and saw a door open by which he
must have entered. I returned, desired the captain and Naomi
to follow, wrapped myself in a cloak, and sword in hand, led
the way through the darkness. I had not gone far when I
found myself treading on a human body. I sprang back, but
the figure, more startled than I, rolled down a succession of
steps before me, and falling against a door, burst it open. A
strong light from within flashed up the stairs, and taking
Naomi’s hand, I led her down this steep and narrow outlet of
the grand gallery. As she came toward the light, a wild cry
was given; a man rushed back, and exclaiming, “It is she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
risen from the grave, the Arabian!” darted through the vast
hall, in which were still a number of domestics setting it in
order after the banquet. Every eye instantly turned to the
spot from which we emerged. Naomi’s white-robed form,
followed by her lover’s and mine wrapped to the brow in our
dark mantles, formidably verified the superstition.</p>

<p>The crowd were already prepared to witness a wonder on
this night of wo; they fled or fell on their faces. The man,
still rushing on, propagated terror before us; and through the
long vista of lighted chambers, where to be seen might have
been ruin, we moved unquestioned until we reached the portal.
It, too, had been thrown open by some of the fugitives; the
gardens were deserted; the troops had been drawn to another
quarter of the palace. Before us was welcome solitude, and
we were soon winding through the wood-paths by the light of
the stars.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>A Minstrel’s Power of Speech</i></span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Flight</div>

<p>While we traversed the grounds, the heaving of the
branches under the wind, which rose in strong gusts from
time to time, and the rush of the rivulets from the hillsides,
which retained the swell of the melting snows, prevented our
hearing other sounds; but when we emerged from this little
forest of every plant that yields fruit or fragrance and began
to climb the surrounding ridge, the sights and sounds to which
I had been so long accustomed broke upon us. To the south
a long line of light showed where Jerusalem was struggling
against a midnight assault, and the uproar of battle came wildly
on the wind. The Roman camp-fires blazed round the promontory
Scopas, like the innumerable crevices of a huge volcanic
hill breathing flame from root to summit. But a more
immediate peril lay behind us. The first height from which
we could see the palace showed us the well-known fire-signals
of the enemy flaming on its battlements. Our escape had been
discovered. The signals were answered from every point of
the horizon. Where a signal was, there was an enemy’s post;
we could not advance a step without the most imminent
chance of seizure, and in those times, death by the shaft or the
sword was the instant consequence. The signals were followed
by the trumpet, and every blast from the palace roof was
answered for miles round.</p>

<p>The whole horizon was alive with enemies, and yet, if in
every call captivity and death had not been the language, this
circling echo of the noblest of all instruments of sound, coming
in a thousand various tones from the varied distances,
softened by the dewy softness of the night, and breathing
from sources invisible, as if they were inspired only by the
winds, or poured from the clouds, might have seemed sublime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tracked by
Bloodhounds</div>

<p>But a new alarm rose in the direction of the forest, which
now lay beneath us like a sea slightly silvered on its thousand
billows by the sinking moon. The trampling of cavalry was
distinctly heard in pursuit, and torches were seen rushing
through the trees. The pursuit had turned into the very path
by which we came, and the baying of a bloodhound up the
ridge was guiding the cavalry to our inevitable capture if we
remained. I was resolved not to be taken while I could fight
or fly, and pointing out to my fellow fugitives the horsemen,
as they scoured the foot of the hills, I plunged down into a
ravine, where I could expect to find only some torrent too
deep for us to pass. But it was at least protracted fate.</p>

<p>I had given Naomi into the hands of her lover, and while
they slowly descended the precipice, returned to its edge to
ascertain whether the enemy were still upon our steps. The
rock toward the summit was splintered into a number of little
pinnacles, grasping one of which, I clung, listening and gazing
with indescribable nervousness. The sounds of pursuit had
perished, or were so mingled with the common sounds of
nature as to be unheard, and I was congratulating myself
upon our total safety, and about to return to the spot where I
had left my companions, when the torch-light shot up from the
dell, immediately below me. I gave a hurried glance along
the ravine, but Naomi was not there. A detachment of
archers was climbing over the huge rocks that filled up its
depth, and flashing torches through every hollow where a
human being could lie.</p>

<p>To rescue my unfortunate charge was my first resolve, and
I began to let myself down the abrupt side of the hollow before
the torches disappeared. They at last seemed to be completely
gone, but as I hung within a few feet of the path, a
growl and a dash at my throat nearly overthrew my steadiness.
I knew that a precipice of immense depth lay underneath,
and in the utter darkness I could have no certainty
that my next step might not carry me over it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Victims of the Cross</div>

<p>My sole expedient was to grasp the rock with one hand and
defend myself to the last with the other. The bloodhound
had tracked me, and he flew again at my throat; but I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
now prepared; I caught him in the bound and whirled him
down the ravine. His howl, as he fell from crag to crag, betrayed
me at once. A hundred torches rushed upward. I
climbed the pinnacle, sprang from its top into a pine thicket,
and winding over a long extent of broken ground, gradually
lost torches and outcries together.</p>

<p>After a pause, to consider in what quarter final escape was
most probable, a glimmering light through the thicket at a
considerable distance toward the city determined me. My
pursuers must be far behind; the loss of the bloodhound diminished
still more their chance of reaching my track through
a remarkably wild and broken district; and come what would,
whether that light was kindled by friends or enemies, I should
see them before they could discover me. I struggled on until
I reached the base of a ridge, on whose farther side the light
gleamed. To ascend it was beyond my powers, but by gliding
along the base I found a crevice, which, enlarged whether by
nature or the human hand, led through the hill. My way in
darkness was brief; I had not gone a third of the distance
when the light shone strongly through the cavern. At its
mouth I stood overwhelmed—I had strayed into the memorable
valley of the Crosses!</p>

<p>Thousands of men, besmeared with blood, dust, and clay,
half naked, brandishing weapons still dripping with gore;
whirling torches; shouting out roars of triumph; howling in
desperate lamentation; kneeling and weeping over the dead
with the most violent affliction; wrapping themselves in robes
and armor; tearing away their raiment, and flinging sword
and spear into the flames; throwing hundreds of corpses into
one promiscuous burning, round which they danced with furious
exultation; carrying away on litters of lances and branches,
corpses that they seemed to hallow as more than mortal;
every strange variety of human passion, wound up to its
wildest height, was pictured before me, and all was thrown
into the most living distinctness by the blaze of an immense
central heap of timber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Last of the Conflict</div>

<p>The horrid cruelties of the execution had been heard of in
Jerusalem, and the spirit of the people was roused to vengeance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
With that imperishable courage which distinguished
them above all nations, a scorn of hazard that in those unhappy
days only urged them to their ruin, they determined to
make the enemy pay in slaughter for the memory of their
warriors. A multitude without a leader, but among whom
served with the simple spear many a leader, poured out from
the gates to attack an enemy flushed with victory, and secured
in entrenchments, impregnable to the naked strength of my
unfortunate countrymen. They divided into two armies, one
of which assaulted the lines, while the other marched to the
valley of the Crosses. The assault on the lines was repelled
after long and desperate displays of intrepidity. It was the
intelligence of this attack that had broken up the banquet.
The Romans sustained heavy losses in the early part of the
night; their outposts in the plain were sacrificed, and the
chief part of their cantonments burned.</p>

<p>But the “army of vengeance,” a name given to it alike by
Jew and Roman, accomplished its purpose with dreadful
retribution. The legionaries posted to defend the valley were
trampled down and destroyed at the first charge. Troop
on troop, sent to extricate them, met with the same fate.
One of the few prisoners described the valley, when his
cohort reached its verge, as having the look of a living
whirlpool, a vast and tempestuous rolling and heaving of infuriate
life, into which the attempt to descend was instant
destruction.</p>

<p>“Every cohort that entered it,” said the centurion, “was
instantly engulfed and seen no more. Last night our legion,
the fifteenth, lay down in their tents five thousand strong; to-night
there are not ten of us on the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>The conflict was long, and the last of the enemy were under
the Jewish sword when I reached the mouth of the fissure.
But in the first intervals of the struggle, the remains of our
tortured people had been taken down from the accursed tree,
tended with solemn sorrow, and given up to their relatives
and friends to be borne back to Jerusalem. The crosses were
thrown into a heap and set on fire; the fallen legionaries underwent
the last indignities that could be inflicted by scorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
and rage; and when even those grew weary, were flung into
the blazing pile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel
Burns a Cross</div>

<p>The fate of the noble Eleazar was still unknown, and to
obtain the certainty of his preservation or to render the last
honor to his remains, I forced my way toward the spot on
which I had seen him awaiting death. But my searches were
in vain; the witnesses on both sides were now where there is
no utterance. Guard, executioner, and victim were clay; the
battle had raged chiefly round that spot, and the ground,
trampled and deep in blood, gave melancholy evidence of the
havoc. There were painful and peculiar signs of the sacrifice
that had extinguished the little group of the converts, and I
poured oil and wine upon their hallowed ashes. A large
fragment of a cross still stood erect in the midst of them.</p>

<p>“Was it upon thee, accursed thing,” I exclaimed, “that the
life-blood of my brother was poured? Was it upon thee that
the last breath was breathed in torture from the lips of virtue,
heroism, and purity? Never shalt thou minister again to the
cruelty of the monsters that raised thee there.”</p>

<p>Indignantly I tore up the beam, and dragging it to the pile
by my single strength—to the wonder of the crowd, who
eagerly offered their help, but whom I would not suffer to
share in this imaginary yet consoling retribution—I rolled it
into the flames amid shouts and rejoicings.</p>

<p>Daybreak was now at hand, and the sounds of the enemy’s
movements made our retreat necessary. We heaped the last
Roman corpse on the pile, covered it with the broken spears,
helmets, and cuirasses of the soldiery, and then left the care
of the conflagration to the wind. From the valley to Jerusalem
our way was crowded with the enemy’s posts; but the
keen eye and agile vigor of the Jew eluded or anticipated the
heavy-armed legionaries, by long experience taught to dread
the night in Judea, and we reached the Grand Gate of Zion
as the sun was shooting his first rays on the pinnacles of the
Temple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wild Host</div>

<p>In those strange and agitated days, when every hour produced
some extraordinary scene, I remember none more extraordinary
than that morning’s marching into the city. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
was a triumph, but how unlike all that bore the name! It
was no idle, popular pageant; no fantastic and studied exhibition
of trophies and treasures; no gaudy homage to personal
ambition; no holiday show to amuse the idleness or feed the
vanity of a capital secure in peace and pampered with the
habits of opulence and supremacy. It was at once a rejoicing,
a funeral, a great act of atonement, a popular preservation,
and a proud revenge on the proudest of enemies.</p>

<p>On the night before, not an eye had closed in Jerusalem.
The Romans, quick to turn every change to advantage, had
suffered the advance of our irregular combatants only until
they could throw a force between them and the gates. The
assault was made, and with partial success; but the population,
once roused, was terrible to an enemy fighting against
walls and ramparts, and the assailants were, after long
slaughter on both sides, drawn off at the sight of our columns
moving from the hills.</p>

<p>We thus marched in unassailed, a host of fifty thousand
men, as wild and strange-looking a host as ever trod to acclamations
from voices unnumbered. Every casement, roof,
battlement, and wall in the long range of magnificent mansions,
leading round by the foot of Zion to Mount Moriah, was
crowded with spectators. Man, woman, and child of every
rank were there straining their eyes and voices, and waving
hands, weapons, and banners in honor of their deliverers from
the terror of massacre. Our motley ranks had equipped themselves
with the Roman spoils wherever they could, and among
the ragged vestures, discolored turbans, and rude pikes, moved
masses of glittering mail, helmets, and gilded lances. Beside
the torn flags of the tribes, embroidered standards were tossing
with the initial of the Cæsars, or the golden image of some
deity, mutilated by our scorn of the idolater.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ester’s Return</div>

<p>The Jewish trumpets had scarcely sent up their chorus,
when it was followed by the clanging of the Roman cymbal,
the long and brilliant tone of the clarion, or the deep roar of
the brass conch and serpent. Close upon ranks exulting and
shouting victory came ranks bearing the honored dead on litters
and bursting into bitter sorrow; then rolled onward thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
bounding and showing the weapons that they had torn
from the enemy; then passed groups of the priesthood—for
they, too, had long taken the common share in the defense—singing
one of the glorious hymns of the Temple; then again
followed litters, surrounded by the wives and children of the
dead, wrapt in inconsolable grief. Bands of warriors, who
had none to care for, the habitual sons of the field; armed
women; chained captives; men covered with the stately
dresses of our higher ranks; biers heaped with corpses;
wagons piled with armor, tents, the wounded and the dead;
every diversity of human circumstance, person, and equipment
that belongs to a state in which the elements of society are let
loose—in that march successively moved before the eye.
With the men were mingled the captured horses of the legionaries;
the camels and dromedaries of the allies; herds of the
bull and buffalo, droves of goats and sheep; the whole one
mighty mass of misery, rejoicing nakedness, splendor, pride,
humiliation, furious and savage life, and honored and lamented
death; the noblest patriotism and the most hideous abandonment
to the excesses of our nature.</p>

<p>As soon as I could extricate myself from the concourse, I
hastened to appease the anxieties of my family, who had suffered
the general terrors of the night, with the addition of
their own stake in my peril and that of Constantius. My
first inquiry was for Esther. To my great delight, she had
returned, but was still in nervous alarm. On the night of
her being led through filial zeal to meet Septimius, she was
seized by a party of armed men and by them conveyed to a
dungeon, where questions had been put to her tending to
charge me at once with magic and correspondence with the
enemy. But this persecution ceased, and she found herself
as unexpectedly set at liberty as she had been seized. At the
gate of her prison the minstrel had met her, and through the
midst of the city, then in its fiercest agitation, had with singular
dexterity conducted her safely home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Minstrel’s Acquirements</div>

<p>A service of this kind was not to go unrewarded, and he had
been suffered to remain under our roof until my return. But
by that time he had made his ground secure by such zealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
service and so many graceful qualities, that even Miriam,
sensitive and sagacious as she was, desired that he should be
retained.</p>

<p>From his knowledge of the various dialects of Asia and his
means of unsuspected intercourse, few events could occur of
which he had not obtained some previous knowledge. His
adroitness in availing himself of his knowledge I had already
experienced in my escape from the gates, and it was to him
that was due the flight of the negroes. A stray charger, a
mask, and the common juggler’s contrivance of breathing
flames, made up the demon that defrauded the Ethiopian exchequer.
But his dexterity in the arts of elegance and taste
was singular; his pencil was dipped in nature, and the
sketches, which he was perpetually making of the wild and
picturesque population that now filled our streets, were incomparable.
He sculptured, he modeled, he wove; he wrought
the gold filigree and chainwork, for which our artists were
famous, with a skill that the most famous of them have
envied. His knowledge of languages seemed the natural result
of his wanderings, but it was extraordinarily various and
pure. The dance and song were part of his profession; but
from the little imperfect harp in use among the minstrels he
drew tones that none other had ever delighted me with—sounds
of such alternate spirit and sweetness, such tender
and heart-reaching power, that they were like an immediate
communication of mind with mind.</p>

<p>And the charm of those acquirements was enhanced by the
graceful carelessness with which he made his estimate of their
value. To my questions how he could at his age have mastered
so many attainments, his reply was that with his three
teachers “everything might be learned; common sense alone
excepted, the peculiar and rarest gift of Providence! Those
three teachers were Necessity, Habit, and Time. At his starting
in life Necessity had told him that, if he hoped to live,
he must labor; Habit had turned the labor into an indulgence;
and Time gave every man an hour for everything unless he
chose to sleep it away.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantius’ Absence</div>

<p>But he had higher topics, and the sagacity of his views, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
a crisis that was made to shake the wisdom of the wise, often
held me in astonishment. The fate of Constantius deeply
perplexed me. He had now been absent long, and no tidings
of him could be heard among the returning warriors further
than that he had joined them in the march to the valley of
the Crosses, had distinguished himself by the intrepidity of
his attack on the legionary guard at the entrance, and was
seen for a short time with a captured standard in his hand
leading on the people. Unable to endure the silent anguish of
those round me, silent only through fear of giving me pain, I
had determined on passing the walls again to seek my brave
and unfortunate son among the fallen. But Miriam’s quick
affection detected me, and with weeping prayers she implored
that “I should not risk a life on which hung her own and
those of her children.”</p>

<p>The sound of the lyre came suddenly upon the air, and to
dissipate the cloud that was gathering on my mind, I wandered
to a balcony where, in the evening light and the pleasant
breathing of the breeze, the minstrel was touching the strings
to the song that had first attracted me. I flung my wearied
frame on a couch and listened until memory became too keen,
and I waved my hand to him to change the strain. He
obeyed, but his heart was in the harp no more; his touch faltered,
the song died away, and he approached me with a
soothingness of voice and manner that none would have
desired to resist.</p>

<p>“My prince,” said he, “you are unhappy, and if your sorrows
can be lightened by any service of mine, why not command
me?”</p>

<p>He waited; but I was too much absorbed in gloomy speculation.</p>

<p>“I can pass the gates,” he timidly continued, “if such be
my lord’s will.”</p>

<p>I made a sign of dissent, for the enemy, since their late
surprise, had begun to urge the siege with increased vigilance.
Yet my anxiety for the fate of Constantius, and
scarcely less for that of Naomi and her lover, must have
been visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s
Prejudices</div>

<p>He still lingered nigh, watching the indications which inward
struggle so forcibly paints upon the external man.</p>

<p>“Prince of Naphtali,” said he in a steadier tone, “among
my teachers I forgot to mention one, and that one the most
effective of all—Self-determination! not the mere disregard
of personal risk, but the intrepidity of the mind. I loved
knowledge, and I pursued it without fear. Nature is boundless,
wise, and wonderful—but prejudice bars up the gate of
knowledge. The man who would learn must despise the timidity
that shrinks from wisdom, as he must hate the tyranny
of opinion that condemns its pursuit. Wisdom is like beauty,
to be won only by the bold.”</p>

<p>I looked up at the young pronouncer of the oracle. His
countenance, animated by the topic, wore an expression of
power, in which I should never have recognized the delicate
and dejected being that he always appeared, except in some
moment of sportiveness, come and gone with the quickness of
lightning.</p>

<p>“Minstrel, apply this to our people or their bigoted and
ignorant leaders. I have no prejudices.”</p>

<p>“All men have them, my prince, and the only distinction
is that in some they are mean, dark, and malignant; in others
they are lofty, generous, and sensitive; yet they are but the
stronger for their nobleness. The mind itself struggles to
throw off the vile and naked fetter. But how many forget
the incumbrance of the chain of gold in its preciousness!”</p>

<p>He hesitated, and then, with a still more elevated air, again
began:</p>

<p>“You despise, for instance, the little ingenuities of our profession,
and I own that in general they deserve nothing else.
But if there were to come before you some true lover of
nature, a disciple of that sublimer philosophy which holds the
secrets of her operations, a master of those superb influences
which rule the frame of things, and yet more, guide the fates
of men and nations—would not your prejudices—and noble
ones they are—lead you to repel the offer of his mysteries?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Minstrel’s Attire</div>

<p>Thoughts tending to those mysteries had so often occurred
to me, and my mind was by its original constitution so fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
the abstruse and the wild, that I listened with interest to the
romance of philosophy. The figure before me was not unsuited
to the illusion; slight, habited in the fanciful dress of
his art, a tunic of purple cloth, bound round the waist with a
girdle; the turban, a mere band of scarlet silk, lightly laid
upon his curls. There was in all this nothing that was not to
be seen at every hour in the streets, but round his waist, instead
of the usual girdle of the minstrels, he wore to-night a
large golden serpent, embossed and colored with a startling
resemblance to life, and a broad golden circlet wrought with
devices of serpents clasping his brow. The countenance was
vividness itself, not without that occasional wandering and
touch of melancholy that showed where early care has been,
yet redeeming the gloom by a smile that had the sweetness
and suddenness of the sunbeam across an April shower.</p>

<p>The evening music of the Roman camps roused me as their
ranks were drawn out for the customary exercise. I turned
from them to glance upon the battlements, that were now
crowded with stragglers of the tribes inhaling the air of the
fields and like myself gazing on the movements of the enemy.
The thought pressed on me how soon and how terribly all this
must end; what were the multitudes to be that now lived and
breathed beneath my glance? The thought was too painful.
I turned from earth to look upon the east, where the evening
star was lying on a rosy cloud, like a spirit sent to bring back
tidings from this troubled world.</p>

<p>“There, boy,” said I, “will your wisdom tell me the story
of that star? Are its people as mad as we? Is there ambition
on one side and folly on the other? Are their great men
the prey of a populace, and their populace the fools of their
great men? Have they orators to inflame their passions;
lawyers to beggar them in pursuit of justice; traders, to cheat
them; heroes, to give them laurels at the price of blood; and
philosophers, to be the worst plagues among them?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rulers of the Empire</div>

<p>“Even that knowledge,” said the minstrel, “may not be
beyond the flight of the human intellect; but prejudices must
be first overcome; we must learn to scorn idle names, defy
idle fears, and use the powers of nature to give us the mastery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
of nature! There are virtues in plants, in metals, even
in words, that to seek, alarms the feeble, but to possess, constitutes
the mighty. There are influences of the air, of the
stars, of even the most neglected and despised things, that
may be gifted to confer the sovereignty of mankind.”</p>

<p>I listened with the passive indulgence of one listening
under a spell; his voice had the sweetness and the flow of
song, and his language was made impressive by gestures of
striking intelligence and beauty. He pointed to the skies, to
the flowers, to the horizon, that glowed like an ocean of amber;
and his fine countenance assumed a changing character
of loftiness, loveliness, or repose as he gazed on the sublime
or the serene.</p>

<p>“Boy,” said I faintly, “are not such the studies by which
the pagan world is made evil?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “No! Light is not further from darkness
than wisdom from the superstition of the pagan. Rome is
filled with the madness that falls upon idolatry for its curse—that
has fallen since the beginning of the world—that shall
fall until its end. She is the slave of ghostly fear. This
hour, among the proudest, boldest, wisest, within the borders
of paganism, there lives not a man unenslaved by the lowest
delusion. The soothsayer, the interpreter of dreams, the
sacrificer, the seller of the dust of the dead, the miserable
pretender to magic—those are the true rulers of the haughty
empire—those are the scepter-bearers to whom the Emperor is
a menial—those are the men of might who laugh at authority,
set counsel at naught, and are sapping the foundations of the
state, were they deep as the center, by sapping the vigor of
the national mind.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King of Metals</div>

<p>While he spoke he was with apparent unconsciousness
sketching some outlines on one of the large marble slabs of
the wall. My eyes had followed the sun until the balcony,
darkened by an old vine, was in the depth of twilight. To
my surprise, the marble began to be covered with fire, but fire
of the softest and most silvery hue. The surprise was increased
by seeing this glowworm luster kindle into form. I
saw the portrait of Constantius, and by his side Naomi and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
her lover. As the lines grew clearer still, I saw them in
chains and in a dungeon! The extraordinary information
which the minstrel had the means of obtaining made me demand
in real alarm whether the picture told the truth, and
that if it did, I should be instantly acquainted with whatever
might enable me to save them.</p>

<p>“And trifles like those fires can excite your astonishment?”
he replied; “what if I were to tell you of wonders such as it
has not entered into the mind of the world to imagine, yet
which are before us in every hour of our lives, are mingled
with everything, are grasped in our insensate hands, are trodden
by our careless feet? See these crystals”—he scraped a
portion of the niter exuding from the wall—“in these is hidden
a power to which the strength of man is but air—to which
the bulwarks round us are but as the leaf on the breeze—at
whose command armies shall vanish, mountains shake, empires
perish—the whole face of society shall change; yet by a
sublime contradiction, combining the greatest evil with the
greatest good—the most lavish waste of life with the most
signal provision for human security!”</p>

<p>“Look on this metal,” said he, pointing to some of the
leaden ornaments of the balcony, “and think what is the
worth of human judgment. Who would give the pearl or the
diamond, the silver or the gold, for this discolored dross?
Yet here is the king of metals—the king of earth; for it can
create, subdue, and rule all that earth produces of power.
Within this dross are treasures hidden, more than earth could
buy—truth, knowledge, and freedom. It can give the dead a
new life and the living a new immortality. It can sink the
haughtiest usurper that ever sinned against man into the lowest
scorn. It can raise the humblest son of obscurity into
preeminence, and even without breaking in upon the seclusion
that he loves, set him forth to every future age crowned
with involuntary glory. It can flash light upon the darkest
corners of the earth—light never to be extinguished. It can
civilize the barbarian; it can pour perpetual increase of happiness,
strength, and liberty round the civilized. It can make
feet for itself that walk through the dungeon walls; wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
that the uttermost limits of the world can not weary; eyes to
which the darkest concealments of evil are naked as the day;
intellect that darts through the universe and solves the
mightiest secrets of nature and of mind! But in it, too, is a
fearful power of ruin.”</p>

<p>He gazed on me with a glance that seemed to shoot fire.</p>

<p>“Holding the keys of opulence and empire,” he continued,
“it can raise men and nations to the most dazzling height—but
it can stain, delude, and madden them until they become
a worse than pestilence to human nature.”</p>

<p>While he spoke, his form assumed a grandeur commensurate
with his lofty topics; the power of his voice awoke with the
awaking power of his mind. My faculties succumbed under
his presence, and I could only exclaim:</p>

<p>“More of those wonders; give me more of those noble evidences
of the supremacy of man!”</p>

<p>“Man!” said my strange enlightener; “look upon him as
he is, and what more helpless thing moves under the canopy
of heaven? The prey of folly, the creature of accident, the
sport of nature, the surge whirls him where it will; the wind
scorns his bidding; the storm crushes him; the lightning
smites him. But look upon man when knowledge has touched
him with her scepter.”</p>

<p>The circlet on his brow seemed to quiver and sparkle with
inward luster; the golden serpent that clasped his robe
seemed to writhe and revolve. I felt like one under fascination.
A strange sense of danger thrilled through me, yet
mixed with a dreamy and luxurious sense of enjoyment. The
air seemed heavy with fragrance, and I sat listening in powerless
homage to a lip molded by beauty and disdain.</p>

<p>“Man, the sport of nature!” said he, pointing to a bead of
dew that hung glittering on a leaf of the vine. “Say man, the
sovereign of nature! With but so feeble an instrument as
this dew-drop he might control and scorn the wind and the
wave! Or would you defy the storm in darkness, without sun
or star speed through the unknown ocean, and add a new
world to the old? Within this fragment lies the secret.”</p>

<p>He struck off a brown splinter from the stone of the balcony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Exiled—Desperate—Undone</div>

<p>“Or would you behold regions to which the stars that now
blaze above our heads are but the portal,” he said; “kingdoms
of light never penetrated by mortal vision; generations of
worlds? By what splendid influence, think you, that the
miracle is to be wrought? Even by this dust!”</p>

<p>He took up a few grains of the sand at his feet and poured
them into my robe. He saw his time.</p>

<p>“Would you,” exclaimed he, “be master of those magnificent
secrets? Then bind this girdle round you and invoke the
name that I shall name.”</p>

<p>I shuddered; the arts of the diviner flashed upon me. But
I had listened too long not to be enfeebled by the temptation.
I felt the passion which lost us paradise—the thirst of forbidden
knowledge. Still I resisted. The young deceiver
pressed me with more distinct promises.</p>

<p>“In your fate,” said he, “the fate of your nation is bound
up. Has it not been declared that a great deliverer is to
come, by whom the face of the enemies of Judah is to be withered,
and the scepter of the earth given to the hand of
Israel? Pledge yourself to me and be that deliverer! You
shrink! Know then—that even while I speak, every creature
of your blood is in chains; your house is desolate; your fortunes
are overthrown; you are cut off root and branch; you
are exiled—desperate—undone!”</p>

<p>I felt a dreadful certainty that his words were true. My
heart bled at the picture of ruin. I wavered. The temptation
tingled through my veins.</p>

<p>“What were the sacrifice of myself,” thought I, “wretched
and sentenced as I was, to the preservation of beings made
for happiness? Or was I to hesitate, let the risk be what it
might, when virtue, patriotism, and boundless knowledge were
added to that preservation? For the trivial honors that man
could give to man, the highest intellects of the earth had been
influenced, but the honors of the restorer of Judah were an
immortal theme—the old splendors of triumph were pronounced
vain and dim, the old supremacy of thrones weakness,
to the domination and grandeur of the sovereign who
should sway the returning tribes of Zion.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judea Must
Fall</div>

<p>The figure approached me, and in a voice that sank with
subtle force through every nerve pronounced the vow that I
was to utter. I was terror-struck; a cloud came over my
sight; strange lights moved and glittered before me. I felt
the unspeakable dread that my faculties should betray me,
and that I should unconsciously yield to a temptation which
yet I had no strength to withstand.</p>

<p>While I sat helpless and almost blind, I was aroused by a
majestic voice. I looked up. Eleazar was at my side. I
would have flung myself into his arms; I would have cast
myself at his feet, but an indescribable sensation told me that
my noble brother was to be so approached no more.</p>

<p>“Well and wisely hast thou resisted,” were his solemn
words, “for in thee are the last fortunes of thy people.
Judea must fall; but fallen with her as thou shalt be, and
desolate, despairing, and wild as shall be thy sojourn, the last
blow of ruin to both would be given hadst thou yielded to the
adversary.”</p>

<p>I glanced at the minstrel. His visage was horror; he
stood deformed, like one dead in the moment of torture. I
closed my eyes against the hideous spectacle. A sound of
hurrying steps made me open them, after how long an interval
I know not. I was alone!</p>

<div class="sidenote">To the Tower
of Antonia</div>

<p>The sounds of the footsteps increased. Overwhelmed as I
was by the trial that my mind had just undergone, I sat
nearly unconscious of external things till I was roused by a
strong grasp from behind and saw myself surrounded by
armed men. I was passively bound; and indifferent to fortune,
was flung into a litter and conveyed to the Tower of
Antonia. In this vast circle of fortifications, the citadel of
the former Roman garrison, the Jewish government was now
held, or rather Onias lorded it over the population. He had
discovered my dwelling, and the first fruit of his knowledge
was my seizure and that of my family. He was now playing
the last throw of that desperate game to which his life had
been given. Power was within his reach, yet there I stood to
thwart him once more, and he was resolved to extinguish the
first source of his danger. Yet I was popular, and with all
his daring, he desired to cast the odium of my death on the
Sanhedrin. I was to be tried on the ground of treating with
the enemy; my family were seized, to shake my courage by
their peril, and I was to be forced to an ignominious confession
as the price of saving their lives.</p>

<p>At the mouth of a dungeon a torch was put into my hands.
I was left to make my way, and the iron door was closed that
had shut out many a wretch from light and life. At the bottom
of the steps I found a man sleeping tranquilly on the
stone. The glare of the torch disturbed him; he started up,
and, looking in my face, exclaimed in the buoyant and cheerful
tone by which I should have recognized him under any
disguise:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Captain Tells of Constantius</div>

<p>“By Jupiter! I knew that we were to meet! If I had to
sleep to-night at the bottom of the sea, I should wager my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
simitar to a straw that our bodies would be found lying side
by side. I presume we mount the scaffold together to-morrow
for the benefit of Jewish morality. Well, then, since our
fates are to be joined, let us begin by—supping together.”</p>

<p>It was the captain! He laid his store on the ground; but I
was heartsick, and could only question him of Naomi, and
the misfortune which had betrayed him into the hands of the
tyrant.</p>

<p>“Our history is the briefest in the world,” was the answer;
“we found ourselves pursued, and we fled. The pursuers followed
faster than my fair mistress could run, or I could carry
her. So we were overtaken before we could clear the rocks,
and our captors were forthwith carrying us to the Roman
camp, in great joy at their prize. But it was intended to be
an unlucky day for the legions. We came across a Jewish
troop, headed by a fine, bold fellow, who dashed upon the
captors and fluttered them like a flight of pigeons. Nothing
could promise better than the affair, for my new captor turned
out to be an old friend, and one of the most gallant that ever
commanded a trireme. Many a day the Cypriot and I chased
(Nemesis forgive us for it!) the pirates through the Cyclades:
I, however, did not know then what pleasant personages the
brothers of the free-trade might be.”</p>

<p>He smiled, and the sigh that followed the smile told how
little he had since found to compensate for his old adventures.</p>

<p>“A Cypriot. Your captor was my son, my Constantius!”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“The very man. When he had found me out under my
Arab trappings, he was all hospitality, and invited me to
share the honors of his princely father’s house. His troop
soon scattered every man to his home, and I was gazing at
the head of an incomparable knave and early acquaintance,
Jonathan, nailed up over the gate for some villainy which he
had not been as adroit as usual in turning to profit, when
Constantius, myself, and that lovely girl, whom I shall never
see more”—he bent his brows at the recollection—“were
seized by the guard, separated, and sent, I suppose, alike to
the dungeon.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Egyptian’s
Papers</div>

<p>Shortly after midnight I was brought before the tribunal.
Onias was my accuser, and I was astonished at the dexterity,
number, and plausibility of his charges—magic, treachery, the
betrayal of my army, the refusal to push the defeated enemy
to a surrender, lest by the cessation of the war my ambition
should be deprived of its object; and last and most astonishing,
the assassination of my kinsman, Jubal, through fear of
his testimony!</p>

<p>I made my defense with the fearlessness of one weary of
life. Some of the charges I explained; others I promptly repelled.
To the imputation of treachery I answered in a single
sentence.</p>

<p>“Read that correspondence with the enemy and judge which
is the traitor.”</p>

<p>I took the Egyptian’s papers from my sash and flung them
on the table. The aspect of my accuser at the words was one
that might have made his sternest hater pity him. He gasped,
he trembled, he gnashed his teeth in rage and terror, and
finally took refuge in the ranks of his followers. But the
judges themselves were in visible perplexity; they looked
over the papers, held them to the lamps, and examined them
in all imaginable ways, until the chief of the Sanhedrin rising,
with a frown that fixed all eyes on me, flung the papers at my
feet. The deepest silence was round me as I took up the rejected
proofs. To my astonishment they were utterly blank!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Secret of the Signet</div>

<p>I now recollected that on my entrance I had been pressed
upon by the crowd. In that moment the false papers must
have been substituted. I saw the Egyptian gliding away
from the side of Onias, and saw by the countenance of my accuser
that the tidings of the robbery had just reached him.
He now declaimed against me with renewed energy. He was
eloquent by nature; the habit of public affairs had given his
speaking that character of practical vigor and reality which is
essential to great public impression; his fortunes hung in the
scale—perhaps his life; and he poured out the whole collected
impulse in a torrent of the boldest and most nervous declamation
upon my head. Still my name was high; my rank was
not to be lightly assailed; my national services were felt; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
even the corrupt judicature summoned for my ruin were not
so insensible to popular feeling as to violate the forms of law
to crush me. The trial lasted during the night. I had the
misery to see my wife, my children, Constantius, Naomi, my
domestics, my fellow warriors, every human being whom there
was a chance of perplexing, or terrifying into testimony,
brought forward against me.</p>

<p>As a last resource, on the secret suggestion of the Egyptian,
who had his own revenge to satisfy, the adventures of the
pirates’ cavern were declaimed upon, and the captain was
summoned from his cell. His figure and noble physiognomy
made him conspicuous, and a general murmur of admiration
arose on his advance to the tribunal. Miriam was at my side.
I felt her tremble; her color went and came, and she drank
in every tone of his voice with an intense anxiety. But when,
in answer to the questions of Onias, he detailed his story, and
in answer to the charge of his being an enemy denied that he
was either Roman or Greek, Miriam’s spirit hung upon every
word.</p>

<p>“A soldier’s best pedigree,” said he, concluding, “is his
sword. I know no more than that I was reared in the house
of a Cypriot noble, to whom I had been brought by a trader
of Alexandria. My protector made me a sailor, and would
have made me his heir, but Roman insolence disgusted me,
and I left my command, bearing with me no other inheritance
than a heart too proud for slavery, my simitar, and this signet,
which I have worn from my infancy.”</p>

<p>He took from his bosom a large sculptured gem fastened
to a chain of pearls. Miriam put forth her trembling hand
for it, read with a starting eye her own name and mine, and
exclaiming, “My son! my son!” tottered forward and fell
fainting into his arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel’s Farewell</div>

<p>I flew to them both, and never did a wo-worn heart beat
with keener joy than when I, too, clasped my son, my long-lost,
my first-born. Yet the cloud gathered instantly. Had
he not come to take the earliest embrace of his parents in the
crisis of their fate—the promise of an unbroken lineage, found
only in the day when my country was in the jaws of destruction—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
father awaking to those loveliest and happiest ties
of nature only when the ax of the traitor or the sword
of the enemy was uplifted to cut them asunder forever—the
prince, the patriot, the warrior, summoned to the first exercise
of his noble rights and duties—when in the next hour a
heap of dust might be all that was left of his family and his
people!</p>

<p>I clung to my son with a fondness thirsting to repay its
long arrear. His desertion in the hands of strangers; the
early hardships; the loss of a mother’s love and a father’s
protection; the insults and privations that the struggler
through the world must bear; the desperate hazards of his
life; even the errors into which necessity and circumstance
had driven him, rose up in judgment against me; I reproached
myself even for the accident, perhaps the irresistible accident,
that gave my infant to the roaring waters. But the tears and
exclamations of the people round us recalled us. I might
then have walked from the hall without any man’s daring to
lay a hand upon me, for the public feeling, touched by the
discovery of my son, was loud for my instant liberation. But
I was not to be satisfied with this imperfect justice, and I demanded
that the tribunal should proceed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Shed Not the Innocent Blood”</div>

<p>The presence of my family was felt too strong for the fears
of my persecutor, and he demanded that they should retire.
An impression, like the warning of a superior spirit, instantly
told me that the parting was forever! The same impression
was evidently on their minds, for their parting was like an
eternal farewell. The whole group at once gathered round
me. Constantius and Salome knelt before me for final forgiveness.
My son and his betrothed bowed their heads to ask
my blessing. Miriam and Esther came last, and silently
hung upon my neck, dissolved in tears of matchless anguish
and love. I lifted my eyes and heart to Heaven, and tho
oppressed with the terrible conviction of my own fate, put
forth my hands and blessed them in the name of the God of
Israel. I saw them pass away. My firmness could bear no
more; I wept aloud. But with my sorrow there was given a
hope—a light across the gloom of my soul. When I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
their stately forms solemnly move along through the fierce
and guilty multitude, and the distant portal shut upon them,
I thought of the sons and daughters of the great patriarch
passing within the door of the ark from the midst of a condemned
world.</p>

<p>The night wore on; the people, exhausted by the length of
a trial, protracted for the purpose, had left the hall nearly
empty; and Onias, now secure of a tribunal that dreaded
nothing but the public eye, urged the decision. The judges
were his creatures through corruption or fear; his followers
alone remained. Sure to be crushed, the fluctuations of hope
were gone; and I listened to the powerful and high-wrought
harangue of my enemy without a feeling but of admiration
for his extraordinary powers, or of pity for their perverter.
While he stood, drinking in with ears and eyes the wonder
and homage of the audience, I myself called for sentence.</p>

<p>“Scorning,” said I, “to reason with understandings that
will not comprehend, and consciences that can not feel, I appeal
from the man of blood to the God of mercies; from the
worse than man of blood, from the corrupter of justice, to
<span class="smcap">Him</span> who shall judge the judge; to Him who shall yet pass
sentence on all in the sight of earth and heaven.”</p>

<p>The chief of the tribunal rose; my condemnation was upon
a lip quivering and pale; he had already in his hand the border
of the robe which he was to rend, in sign that the accused
was rent from Israel.</p>

<p>A confusion at the portal checked him, and the words resounded:
“Shed not the innocent blood!” The voice was as
a voice from the sepulcher, melancholy, but searching to the
very heart. The guard gave way, and a man, covered from
head to foot with a sepulchral garment, rushed up the immense
hall. At the foot of the tribunal he flung off the garment,
and disclosed a face and form that well might have
ranked him among the dwellers of the grave.</p>

<p>“I have come from the tombs,” exclaimed he; “I had lain
down to die in the resting-place of my fathers, in the valley
of Jehoshaphat. A man in white raiment stood beside me
and commanded me to come and bear witness of the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
The Romans were round me—he led me through them; the
battlements were before me—he led me through them; riot,
fury, and frenzy stood in my path through your city—he led
me through them; and lo! here I come, and proclaim by his
command: ‘Shed not the innocent blood.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Onias
the Accused</div>

<p>Onias stood paralyzed. No memory of mine could recall
the haggard features of the stranger. The chief of the tribunal
in manifest confusion required his name.</p>

<p>“My name,” he answered, with a wild wave of his hand,
“is nothing—air—is gone. What I was, is past; what I
shall be, the tomb alone must tell; but what I am, is the witness,
commissioned to proclaim Onias the betrayer of the
blood of your nobles, the slave of Rome, the traitor to his
country, the apostate to his religion.”</p>

<p>All hands were lifted up in astonishment. Onias, sick at
heart, made a feeble gesture of denial.</p>

<p>“Dares the traitor deny his own handwriting?” was the indignant
reply. “Let him read his treason, committed within
these twelve hours.”</p>

<p>He stalked over to the guilty Onias and held his letters to
the Roman general before his shrinking eye.</p>

<p>While my eyes were fixed on the portal through which had
vanished my last hope of happiness, I was startled by an outcry,
and I saw the gleam of steel at my throat. Onias, in despair
of smiting me by the arm of the law, had made a frenzied
effort to destroy me by his own. Quick as lightning the
stranger threw himself between us and grasped the assassin;
they struggled—they were involved in the large and loose
robe and fell together. I sprang forward to separate them.
But the deed was done. Onias lay rolling upon the ground;
the dagger was in the stranger’s grasp, and it was crimson to
the hilt. I could feel no vindictiveness against the dying,
and I offered him my hand. He threw a violent expression
of scorn into his stiffening features, and cried at convulsive
intervals:</p>

<p>“No compassion—no hypocrisy for me—I die as I lived.
I hated you, for you thwarted me.—You have the best of the
game now; but if I had lived till to-morrow, I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
been lord of Jerusalem.—The Romans will settle all.—You
and yours would have been in my power.—You shall perish.—That
boy is your son; he was brought to me in his infancy;
I hated you as my rival; and I swore that you should never
see your first-born again. I sold him to the Alexandrian.—You
shall not live to triumph over me; your dungeon shall be
your tomb; another night, and you sleep no more, or sleep
forever.”</p>

<p>He gathered his mantle over his face and died.</p>

<p>His followers, after the first consternation, demanded
vengeance on the stranger. But it was now my time to protect
him, and I declared that no man should strike him but
through me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Last of
Jubal</div>

<p>“This is noble and generous,” interrupted he, “but useless.
I, too, am dying; but I rejoice that I am dying by the wound
meant for you. Have I at last atoned? Have you forgotten?
Can you forgive? Then, prince of Naphtali, lay your hand
upon this heart, and while it beats believe that there you are
honored. Time has changed me; misery has extinguished the
last trace of what I was. Farewell, my kinsman, friend,
chieftain—and remember—Jubal.”</p>

<p>I caught him in my arms; my heart melted at his sufferings,
his generous attachment, his heroic devotion, his deep
repentance.</p>

<p>“You have more than atoned,” I exclaimed; “you are more
than forgiven. Live, my manly, kind, high-hearted Jubal;
live for the honor of your race—of your country—of human
nature.”</p>

<p>He looked up with a smile of gratitude, and faintly uttering,
“I die happy,” breathed in my arms the last breath of
one of the most gallant spirits that ever left the world.</p>

<p>Loud shouts abroad and blazes that colored the roof with
long columns of lurid light put an end to the deliberation of
the tribunal. The enemy were assaulting the citadel, and the
mockery of justice was summarily closed by returning me to
my dungeon, to await times fitter for the calmness of judicial
murder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dungeon’s Heat</div>

<p>The assault continued for some hours; but to my cell, sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
in the very foundations of the fortress, day never came; and
I lay, still buried in darkness, when I heard sounds like the
blows of pickaxes, and from time to time the fall of heavy
bodies, followed by a roar. The air grew close, and chill as
the dungeon had been, I experienced a sensation of heat still
more painful. The heat increased rapidly. I tried to avoid
it by shifting my place in the vault. But the evil was not to
be baffled—the air grew hotter and hotter. I flung myself on
the pavement to draw a cool breath from the stones; they
began to glow under me. I ran to the door of the dungeon;
it was iron, and the touch scorched me. I shouted, I tore at
the walls, at the massive rings in the floor, less perhaps from
the hope of thus escaping than from the vague eagerness to
deaden present pain by violent effort. But I tore up the
pavement and broke down the fragments of the walls in vain.
The walls themselves began to split with the heat; smoke
eddied through the crevices of the immense stones, and the
dungeon was filled with fiery vapor. My raiment encumbered
me; I tore it away, and on the floor saw it fall in ashes. I
felt the agonies of suffocation; and at last, helpless and hopeless,
threw myself down, like my raiment, to be consumed.</p>

<p>I had scarcely touched the stone when I felt it shake and
vibrate from side to side. A hollow noise like distant thunder
echoed through the vault; the walls shook, collapsed, opened,
and I was plunged down a chasm, and continued rolling for
some moments in a whirl of stones, dust, earth, and smoke.</p>

<p>When it subsided, I found myself lying on the green sward,
in noonday, at the bottom of a valley, with the tower of Antonia
covered with the legionaries, five hundred feet above
me. The remnants of huge fires round pillars of timber explained
the mystery. The enemy had undermined the wall,
and by burning the props, had brought it down at the moment
of the assault. Onias, the planner of the attack, for
which he was to be repaid with the procuratorship of Judea,
had placed me in the spot where ruin was to begin, and
cheered his dying moments with the certainty that, acquitted
or not, there I must be undone!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations</div>

<p>I long lay confused and powerless beside my dungeon!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
But the twilight air revived me, and I crept through the deserted
entrenchments of the enemy until I reached one of the
gates, where I announced my name, and was received with
rejoicings. The heart of my countrymen was heroic to the
last, and deeply was its heroism now demanded; for the
whole force of the enemy had been brought up for final assault,
and when I entered, every portion of the walls was the
scene of unexampled battle. Where the ground suffered the
approach of troops, the enemy’s columns, headed by archers
and slingers innumerable, rushed to the rampart, climbing up
the breaches, with their shields covering their heads. Against
the towers were wheeled towers filled with troops, who descended
on the wall and fought us hand to hand. We felt
the continued blows of the battering-rams, shaking the battlements
under our feet. Where the ground repelled direct assault,
there the military machines poured havoc, and those
were the most dreaded of all.</p>

<p>The skill of man, exerted for ages on the arts of compendious
slaughter, has scarcely produced the equals of those
horrible engines. They threw masses of unextinguishable
fire, of boiling water, of burning oil, of red-hot flints, of
molten metal, from distances that precluded defense, and
with a force that nothing could resist. The catapult shot
stones of a hundred-weight from the distance of furlongs,
with the straightness of an arrow, and with an impulse that
ground everything in their way to powder. The fortitude
that scorned the Roman spear, and exulted in the sight of the
columns mounting the scaling-ladders, as mounting to sure
destruction, quailed before the tremendous power of the catapult.
The singular and ominous cry of the watchers, who
gave notice of its discharge, “The son cometh,” was a sound
that prostrated every man upon his face, until the crash of
the walls told that the blow was given.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Wo to the City!”</div>

<p>Every thought that I had now for earth was in the tower of
Antonia! But there the legions rendered approach impossible,
and I could only gaze from a distance and see, in the bitterness
of my soul, the enemy gradually forcing their way from
rampart to rampart. It was in vain that I strove to collect a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
few who would join me in a desperate attempt to succor its
defenders. I was left alone, and sitting on the battlements,
I took the chance of some friendly spear or stone.</p>

<p>Through all the roar I heard the voice of Sabat, the Ishmaelite:
the eternal “Wo!—wo!—wo!” loud as ever, and in
appalling unison with the hour. He now came rushing along
the wall with the same rapid and vigorous stride as of old,
but his betrothed no longer followed him. She was borne in
his arms! The stones from the engines thundered against the
wall; they tore up the strong buttresses like weeds; they
struck away whole ranks of men, and whirled their remnants
through the air. They leveled towers and swept battlements
away with their defenders at a blow. But Sabat moved unshrinking
on his wild mission. His cry now was terrible
prophecy.</p>

<p>“A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from
the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house,
a voice against the bridegroom and the bride, a voice against
this whole people.”</p>

<p>He stopped before me, and pointing to the face of his bride,
said with a sudden faltering and tears: “She is gone; she is
dead. She died last night. I promised to die too. She follows
me no more. It is I that must follow her.”</p>

<p>Death was in his face, and my only wonder was that a
form so utterly reduced could live and move. I offered him
some provision from the basket of a dead soldier at my feet.
For the first time he took it, thanked me, and ate. Not less
to my surprise, he continued gazing round him on the movements
of the enemy, on the temple, the tower of Antonia,
and the hills. But his station was eminently perilous, and I
pointed out one of the military engines taking its position to
play upon the spot where we were. He refused to stir.</p>

<p>“The look may be long,” said he, “when a man looks his
last.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Conflict of Heaven and Earth</div>

<p>I heard the roar of the engine, and leaped from the rampart
to escape the discharge. Sabat stood, and again began
his cry: “Wo to the city, and to the holy house, and to the
people!” The discharge tore up a large portion of the battlement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
Sabat never moved limb or feature. The wall was cut
away on his right and left, as if it had been cut with an ax.
He stood calmly on the projecting fragment with his lips to
the lips of his bride. I saw the engine leveled again, and
again called to him to escape. He gave me no answer but a
melancholy smile; and crying out, with a voice that filled the
air: “Wo to myself!” stood. I heard the rush of the stone.
It smote Sabat and his bride into atoms!<a name="ENanchor_55" id="ENanchor_55"></a><a href="#Endnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The fall of our illustrious and unhappy city was supernatural.
The destruction of the conquered was against the
first principles of Roman polity, and to the last hour of our
national existence, Rome held out offers of peace, and lamented
our frantic determination to be undone. But the decree
was gone forth from a mightier throne. During the latter
days of the siege, a hostility to which that of man was as
the grain of sand to the tempest that drives it on, overpowered
our strength and senses.</p>

<p>Fearful shapes and voices in the air; visions startling us
from our short and troubled sleep; lunacy in its most hideous
forms; sudden death in the midst of vigor; the fury of the
elements let loose upon our unsheltered heads; we had every
terror and evil that could beset human nature, but pestilence;
the most probable of all in a city crowded with the famishing,
the diseased, the wounded, and the dead. Yet, tho
the streets were covered with the unburied, tho every wall
and trench was streaming with gore, tho six hundred thousand
corpses lay flung over the rampart, naked to the sun—pestilence
came not; for if it had come, the enemy would
have been scared away. But the “abomination of desolation,”
the pagan standard, was fixed, where it was to remain until
the plow passed over the ruins of Jerusalem!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Last Sign</div>

<p>On one night, that fatal night! no man laid his head upon
his pillow. Heaven and earth were in conflict. Meteors
burned above us; the ground shook under our feet; the volcano
blazed; the wind burst forth in irresistible blasts, and
swept the living and the dead in whirlwinds, far into the
desert. We heard the bellowing of the distant Mediterranean,
as if its waters were at our side, swelled by a new deluge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
The lakes and rivers roared and inundated the land. The
fiery sword shot out tenfold fire. Showers of blood fell.
Thunder pealed from every quarter of the heaven. Lightning,
in immense sheets, of an intensity and duration that
turned the darkness into more than day, withering eye and
soul, burned from the zenith to the ground, and marked its
track by forests on flame, and the shattered summits of the
hills.</p>

<p>Defense was not thought of, for the mortal hostility had
passed from the mind. Our hearts quaked for fear, but it
was to see the powers of heaven shaken. All cast away the
shield and the spear, and crouched before the descending judgment.
We were conscience-smitten. Our cries of remorse,
anguish, and horror were heard through the uproar of the
storm. We howled to the caverns to hide us; we plunged
into the sepulchers to escape the wrath that consumed the
living; we would have buried ourselves under the mountains!
I knew the cause, the unspeakable cause, and knew that the
last hour of crime was at hand. A few fugitives, astonished
to see one man among them not sunk into the lowest feebleness
of fear, came round me, and besought me to lead them
to some place of safety, if such were now to be found on
earth. I told them openly that they were to die, and counseled
them to die in the hallowed ground of the Temple.
They followed me through streets encumbered with every
shape of human suffering, to the foot of Mount Moriah. But
beyond that, we found advance impossible. Piles of cloud,
whose darkness was palpable, even in the midnight in which
we stood, covered the holy hill. Still, not to be daunted by
anything that man could overcome, I cheered my disheartened
band, and attempted to lead the way up the ascent. But I
had scarcely entered the cloud when I was swept downward
by a gust that tore the rocks in a flinty shower round me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Let Us Go Hence”</div>

<p>Now came the last and most wondrous sign that marked the
fate of Israel. While I lay helpless, I heard the whirlwind
roar through the cloudy hill, and the vapors began to revolve.
A pale light, like that of the rising moon, quivered on their
edges, and the clouds rose and rapidly shaped themselves into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
the forms of battlements and towers. The sound of voices
was heard within, low and distant, yet strangely sweet. The
luster brightened, and the airy building rose, tower on tower,
and battlement on battlement. In awe that held us mute, we
knelt and gazed upon this more than mortal architecture,
which continued rising and spreading, and glowing with a
serener light, still soft and silvery, yet to which the broadest
moonbeam was dim. At last it stood forth to earth and
heaven, the colossal image of the first Temple, the building
raised by the wisest of men, and consecrated by the visible
glory.</p>

<p>All Jerusalem saw the image, and the shout that, in the
midst of their despair, ascended from its thousands and tens
of thousands, told what proud remembrances were there.
But a hymn was heard that might have hushed the world.
Never fell on my ear, never on the human sense, a sound so
majestic, yet so subduing; so full of melancholy, yet of
grandeur. The cloudy portal opened, and from it marched a
host such as man had never seen before, such as man shall
never see but once again; the guardian angels of the city of
David!—they came forth glorious, but with wo in all their
steps; the stars upon their helmets dim; their robes stained;
tears flowing down their celestial beauty.</p>

<p>“Let us go hence,” was their song of sorrow; “Let us go
hence,” was answered by the sad echoes of the mountains.
“Let us go hence,” swelled upon the night to the farthest
limits of the land. The procession lingered long on the summit
of the hill. Then, the thunder pealed; and they rose at
the command, diffusing waves of light over the expanse of
heaven. Their chorus was heard, still magnificent and melancholy,
when their splendor was diminished to the brightness
of a star. The thunder roared again; the cloudy temple was
scattered on the winds; and darkness, the omen of her grave,
settled upon Jerusalem!</p>

<p>I was roused from my consternation by the voice of a
man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Glance toward the Temple</div>

<p>“What!” said he, “sitting here, when all the world is
stirring? Poring over the faces of dead men, when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
should be the foremost among the living? All Jerusalem in
arms, and yet you scorn your time to gain laurels?”</p>

<p>The haughty and sarcastic tone was familiar to my recollection;
but to see, as I did, a Roman soldier within a few
feet of me was enough to make me spring up, and draw my
simitar, careless of consequences.</p>

<p>“You ought to know me,” said he, without moving a
muscle; “for tho it is some years since we met, we have
not been often asunder. And so here you have been sitting
these twelve hours among corpses, to no better purpose than
losing your time and your memory together!”</p>

<p>I looked round; the sun was in his meridian. The little
band that I had led to the foot of the mountain were lying
dead, to a man.</p>

<p>“Are you not a Roman?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No; but I conclude that nearly as much absurdity and
mischief may be committed under these trappings as under
any other, and therefore I wear them. But you may exchange
with me if you like. This cuirass and falchion will help you
to money, riot, violence, and vice—and what more do nine-tenths
of mankind ask for in their souls? Take my offer and
you will be on the winning side; another thing that men like.
But be expeditious, for before this sun dips his forehead in
the Asphaltites, the bloodshed and robbery will be over.”</p>

<p>His laugh, as he uttered the words, was bitterness itself,
and I felt my flesh instinctively shudder. But a glance
toward the Temple told me that the words were true. The
legions had forced their way to the foot of the third and
weakest rampart, which I now saw flying in pieces under the
blows of the battering-rams. They must have marched by the
very spot where I had sat since midnight, and I probably
escaped only by being taken for one of the dead. I wrung
my hands in agony. He burst into a wild roar of derision.</p>

spear or the arrow comes, and quick as thought their troubles
are at an end. Man!—the true misery is to live, to be constrained
to live, to feel the wants, wearinesses, and weaknesses
of life, yet to drag on existence; to be—what I am.”</p>

<p>He tore the helmet from his forehead, and, with a groan of
agony, flung it to a measureless distance in the air. In amaze
and terror I beheld Epiphanes! The same Greek countenance,
the same kingly presence, the same strength and heroic stature,
and the same despair, were before me that, in the early
years of my wo, I had seen on the shores of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>“I told you,” said he, with a sudden return to calmness,
“that this day would come; and to tell you so required no
spirit of prophecy. There is a time for all things, long-suffering
among the rest; and your countrymen had long ago
come to that time. But one grand hope was still to be given;
they cast it from them! Ages on ages shall pass before they
learn the loftiness of that hope or fulfil the punishment of
that rejection. Yet, in the fulness of time, shall the light
break in upon their darkness. They shall ask, Why are we
the despised, the branded, the trampled, the abjured, of all
nations? Why are the barbarian and the civilized alike our
oppressors? Why do contending faiths join in crushing us
alone? Why do realms, distant as the ends of the earth, and
diverse as day and night—alike those who have heard our
history, and those who have never heard of us but as the sad
sojourners of the earth—unite in one cry of scorn? And what
is the universal voice of nature but the voice of the King of
nature?”</p>

<p>I listened in reverence to language that pierced my heart
with an intense power of truth, yet with a pang that made me
writhe. I longed, yet dreaded, to hear again the searching
and lofty accents of this being of unwilling wisdom.</p>

<p>“Man of terrible knowledge,” said I, “canst thou tell for
what crime this judgment shall come?”</p>

<p>Awe was written upon his mighty brow, and his features
quivered as he slowly spoke.</p>

<p>“Their crime? There is no name for it. The spirits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
heaven weep when they think of it. The spirits of the abyss
tremble. Man alone, the man of Judea alone, could commit
that horror of horrors.”</p>

<p>He paused and prostrated himself at the words; then rising,
rapidly uttered: “Judge of the crime by its punishment.
From the beginning, Israel was stubborn, and his stubbornness
brought him to sorrow. He rebelled, and he was warned by
the captivity of a monarch or the slaughter of a tribe. He
sinned more deeply, for he was the slave of impurity; then
was his kingdom divided; yet a few years saw him powerful
once more. He sinned more deeply still, for he sought the
worship of idols. Then came his deeper punishment, in the
fall of his throne and the long captivity of his people. But
even Babylon sent back the forgiven.</p>

<p>“Happy, I say to you, happy will be the hour for Israel—for
mankind, for creation—when he shall take into his
hand the records of his fathers, and, in tears, ask, What is
that greater crime than rebellion? than blasphemy? than impurity?
than idolatry? which, not seventy years, nor a thousand
years, of sorrow have seen forgiven; which has prolonged
his wo into the old age of the world—which threatens
him with a chain not to be broken but by the thunder-stroke
that breaks up the universe!”</p>

<p>“And still,” said I, trembling before the living oracle,—“still
is there hope?”</p>

<p>“Look to that mountain,” was the answer, as he pointed to
Moriah. Its side, covered with the legions advancing to the
assault, shone in the sun like a tide of burning brass. “It
is now a sight of splendid evil!” exclaimed he. “But upon
that mountain shall yet be enthroned a Sovereign before
whom the sun shall hide his head, and at the lifting of whose
scepter the heaven and the heaven of heavens shall bow down!
To that mountain shall man, and more than man, crowd for
wisdom and happiness. From that mountain shall light flow
to the ends of the universe, and the government shall be the
Everlasting!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roar of
Assault</div>

<p>The roar of the assault began, and my awful companion
was recalled to the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In Front of the Sanctuary</div>

<p>“I must see the end of this battle,” said he, in his old
mixture of sarcasm and melancholy; “man’s natural talent
for making himself miserable may go far, but he is still the
better for a teacher. On the top of that hill there are twenty
thousand men panting for each other’s blood like tigers; and
yet without me they would leave the grand business undone,
after all.”</p>

<p>“But one word more,” I cried, giving my last look to the
tower of Antonia, on which the eagles now glittered.</p>

<p>He anticipated me.</p>

<p>“All are safe—they are in the hands of Septimius, who will
deal with them in honor. He solicited the command, that he
might provide for their security. They comfort themselves
with the hope that you will return. But return you never
will. They will be happy in the hope—until sorrow is too
long shut out to find room when it comes; they love you, and
will love you long, but there is an end of all things. And
now, farewell!”</p>

<p>“And now, onward,” said I. “But every spot is crowded
with the Roman columns. How am I to pass those spears?”</p>

<p>He laughed wildly, flung his arm round me, as of old, and
ran, with the speed of a stag, round the foot of the hill to an
unobstructed side. The ascent was nearly perpendicular; but
he bounded up the crags without drawing a breath, placed me
on a battlement, and was gone!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mark of Ruin</div>

<p>Below me war raged in its boundless fury. The enemy had
forced their way, and the exasperated Jews, contemptuous of
life, fought them with the rage of wild beasts. When the
lance was broken, the knife was the weapon; when the knife
failed, they tore with their hands and teeth. Masses of
stone, torches, even dead bodies, everything that could minister
to destruction, were hurled from the roofs on the assailants,
who were often repulsed with deadly havoc. But they
still made way; the courts of the Gentiles, of the Israelites,
and of the priests were successively stormed; and the legions
at length established themselves in front of the Sanctuary.
A howl of wrath, at the possible profanation of the Holy of
Holies, rose from the multitude. I rushed from the battlement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
and showing myself to the people, demanded “who
would follow me?” The crowd exulted at the sight of their
well-known chieftain; and in the impulse of the moment we
poured on the enemy, and drove them from the court of the
Sanctuary. Startled by the sudden reverse, the Roman generals
renewed their proposal for a surrender, and Titus himself,
at the most imminent hazard, forced his way to the
portal, and besought me to surrender and save the Temple.</p>

<p>But Jerusalem was marked for ruin. While I was in the
very act of checking the shower of spears, I heard the voice
of one of those extraordinary beings who, by mad predictions
of the certain succor of Heaven, kept up the resistance while
there was a man to be slaughtered. He was standing on the
roof of a vast cloister, surrounded by a crowd of unfortunate
men, whom his false prophecies were infuriating against the
offer of life. I recognized the impostor, or the demon, by
whom the Roman mission had been destroyed. The legionaries
pointed in vain to the flames already rising round the
cloisters. The predictions grew bolder still, and the words of
truth were answered by showers of missiles. The flames suddenly
burst out through the roof, and the whole of its defenders,
to the number of thousands, sank into the conflagration.
When I looked round after the shock, this fearful
being, without a touch of fire on his raiment, was haranguing
in a distant quarter, and whether man or fiend, urging the
multitude to their fate!</p>

<p>This was the day of days, the ninth day of the month Ab,
the anniversary of the burning of the Temple by the king of
Babylon. One thousand one hundred and thirty years, seven
months, and fifteen days were past, from its foundation by
our great King Solomon! My attack had repelled the legionaries,
and Titus, exhausted and dispirited, began to withdraw
the routed columns from the front of the Temple. It was the
fifth hour; the sun was scorching up their strength, and I
looked proudly forward to victory and the preservation of the
Temple!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Enemy—Fire</div>

<p>As I was standing on the portal of the court of the Sanctuary,
and gazing at the rout of the troops toward the tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
of Antonia, I heard a voice close to my ear: “I told you that
this day would end in nothing without me.” I turned, but he
was already far away among the crowd; and before I could
even speak, I saw him, torch in hand, bound into the Golden
window, beside the veil of the Holy Place. The inner Temple
was instantly in a blaze. Our cries and the sight of the
flames brought back the enemy at full speed. I saw that
the fatal hour was come, and collecting a few brave men,
took my post before the veil, to guard the entrance with
my blood.</p>

<p>But the legions rushed onward, crying out that “they were
led by the Fates,” and that “the God of the Jews had given
His people and city into their hands.” The torrent was irresistible.
Titus rushed in at its head, exclaiming, that “the
Divinity alone could have given the stronghold into his power,
for it was beyond the hope and strength of man.” My devoted
companions were torn down in an instant. I was forced
back to the veil of the Holy of Holies, fighting at random in
the midst of the legionaries, who now saw no enemies but
each other. In the fury of plunder they deluged the Portico
and the Sanctuary with blood.</p>

<p>The golden table of Pompey, the golden vine, the trophies
of Herod, were instantly torn away. Subordination was lost.
The troops trampled upon their officers. Titus himself was
saved only by cutting his way through those madmen. But I
longed to die, and give my last breath and the last drop of my
veins to the seat of Sanctity and Glory. I fought—I taunted—I
heaped loud scorn on the profaners—I was covered from
head to foot with gore; but it was from the hearts of Romans—I
toiled for death; but I remained without a wound. Yet,
wo to the life that came within the sweep of my simitar.
The last blow that I struck was at an impious hand, put forth
to grasp the veil that shut the Holy of Holies from the human
gaze. The hand flew from the body, and the spoiler fell
groaning at my feet. He sent up an expiring look, and I
knew the countenance of my persecutor, Cestius!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ruin of the Temple</div>

<p>But a new enemy had come, conqueror alike of the victor
and the vanquished—fire.<a name="ENanchor_56" id="ENanchor_56"></a><a href="#Endnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> I heard its roar round the sanctuary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
The Romans, appalled, fled to the portal; but they
were doomed. A wall of fire stood before them. They
rushed back, tore down the veil, and the Holy of Holies
stood open. The blaze melted the plates of the roof in a
golden shower above me. It calcined the marble floor; it
dissipated in vapor the inestimable gems that studded the
walls. All who entered lay turned to ashes. So perish the
profaners! But on the sacred Ark the flame had no power.
It whirled and swept in a red orb round the untouched symbol
of the throne of thrones. Still I lived, but I felt my strength
giving way: the heat withered my sinews—the flame extinguished
my sight.</p>

<p>Bleeding, blind, frantic, I still fought until I sank under a
heap of dead. In defiance of all prediction, I now believed
my death inevitable. At once I heard the shouts of the conquerors
and the fall of the pillars of the Temple. I welcomed
the living grave! In all the wildness of the uproar I
heard the voice: “<span class="smcap">Tarry thou till I come!</span>” The world
disappeared from before me!</p>

<p class="tb">Here I pause. I had undergone that portion of my unhappy
career which was to be passed among my people. My life
as father, husband, and citizen was at an end. Thenceforth I
was to be a solitary being.</p>

<p>My fate had yet scarcely fallen upon me, but I was now to
feel it in the disruption of every gentler tie that held me to
life. I was to make my couch with the savage, the outcast,
and the slave. I was to see the ruin of the mighty and the
overthrow of empires. Yet in the tumult that changed the
face of the world, I was still to live and be unchanged.
Every sterner passion that disturbs our nature was to reign in
successive tyranny over my soul. And fearfully was the decree
fulfilled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salathiel the Eternal Wanderer</div>

<p>In revenge for the fall of Jerusalem, I traversed the globe
to seek out an enemy of Rome. I found in the northern
snows a man of blood; I stirred up the soul of Alaric and led
him to the rock of Rome. In revenge for the insults heaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
on the Jew by the dotards and dastards of the city of Constantine,
I sought out an instrument of compendious ruin: I
found him in the Arabian sands, and poured ambition into the
soul of the enthusiast of Mecca. In revenge for the pollution
of the ruins of the Temple, I roused the iron tribes of
the West, and at the head of the crusaders expelled the Saracens.
I fed full on the revenge, and I felt the misery of revenge!</p>

<p>A passion for the mysteries of nature seized me. I toiled
with the alchemist; I wore away years in perplexities of the
schoolmen; and I felt the guilt and emptiness of unlawful
knowledge.</p>

<p>A passion for human fame seized me. I drew my sword in
the Italian wars—triumphed—was a monarch—and learned
to curse the hour when I first dreamed of fame!</p>

<p>A passion for gold seized me. I felt the gnawing of avarice—the
last infirmity of the fallen mind. Wealth came, to my
wish and to my torment. In the midst of royal treasures I
was poorer than the poorest. Days and nights of misery were
the gift of avarice. I felt within me the undying worm.
In my passion I longed for regions where the hand of man
had never rifled the mine. I found a bold Genoese, and led
him to the discovery of a new world. With its metals I inundated
the old, and to my own misery added the misery of
two hemispheres!</p>

<p>But the circle of the passions, a circle of fire, was not to
surround my fated steps forever. Calmer and nobler aspirations
were to rise in my melancholy heart. I saw the birth of
true science, true liberty, and true wisdom. I lived with
Petrarch, among his glorious relics of the genius of Greece
and Rome. I stood enraptured beside the easel of Angelo and
Raphael. I conversed with the merchant kings of the Mediterranean.
I stood at Mentz beside the wonder-working
machine that makes knowledge imperishable and sends it with
winged speed through the earth. At the pulpit of the mighty
man of Wittenberg I knelt; Israelite as I was, and am, I
did voluntary homage to the mind of Luther!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Future</div>

<p>But I must close these thoughts, as wandering as the steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
of my pilgrimage. I have more to tell—strange, magnificent,
and sad.</p>

<p>But I must wait the impulse of my heart. Or, can the
happy and the high-born, treading upon roses, have an ear
for the story of the Exile, whose path has for a thousand
years been in the brier and the thorn!</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_1" id="Endnote_1"></a><a href="#ENanchor_1">[1]—page 3.</a> The legend of the Wandering Jew first appeared in the thirteenth century,
in the chronicle of Matthew of Paris, who professes to have received his information
from an Armenian bishop to whom the hero had himself communicated the events.
According to this version, he was a servant in the house of Pilate, named Cartaphilus,
and gave Christ a blow as He was dragged out of the palace to execution. Another and
perhaps more familiar version, probably of the fifteenth century and of German origin,
states that he was a shoemaker named Ahasuerus. As Jesus bore His cross along the
<i lang="it">via dolorosa</i>, staggering with pain and weakness, He leaned for a moment against
the doorway of the rude shopkeeper, who, with cursing and bitterness, ordered him to
“go on.” The sufferer looked upon him and said: “I go, but tarry thou till I come!”
From that awful moment he found life a burden and death an impossibility. From time
to time he was able to rejoice in gray hairs and a stooping form, but regularly these
indications of the end would vanish, and clothed again in the form of youth, he felt the
look and heard in his soul the dread voice bidding him wander on and on forever. All
versions agree touching the verdict of Christ, that he should wander on earth till the
Second Coming.</p>

<p>In its deepest import, “the tradition is simply a wonderful picture of a people—a
people forever suffering and yet undying; forever doomed to wander; without a home
or any fixed abiding-place; safe nowhere, and yet immortal; trampled and beaten;
robbed and persecuted, and yet, strangely, living and flourishing in spite of all. The
most vigorous, virile, and healthful people under the sun; the bravest and most enduring
in battle or siege; the most patriotic and loyal of all peoples, they stedfastly,
through all their wanderings and sorrows, cling to a land which is but a memory or
a dream.”</p>

<p>In this story, Dr. Croly adds to the typical traditions, peculiar features of his own.
Having such a hold on popular imagination, the Wandering Jew has figured very
largely in fiction, particularly in the works of A. W. Schlegel, Klingemann, Béranger,
Eugene Sue, Hans Christian Andersen, and others.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_2" id="Endnote_2"></a><a href="#ENanchor_2">[2]—page 11.</a> The Mount of Corruption lay to the south of Jerusalem, across the Valley
of Hinnom. Its summit looks down upon the spot in connection with which the Jewish
ideas of the future life of the wicked were formed. The valley, named, according
to Dean Stanley, from “some ancient hero, the son of Hinnom,” is first mentioned in
Joshua (xv. 8; xviii. 16), in marking out the boundary-line between Judah and Benjamin.
Solomon erected high places there for Moloch (1 Kings xi. 7), whose horrid rites
were revived by later idolatrous kings. Ahaz and Manassah made their children
“pass through the fire” in this valley (2 Kings xvi. 3; 2 Chron. xxviii. 3; xxxiii. 6);
and the fiendish custom of sacrificing infants to the fire-gods seems to have been kept
up for some time in Tophet, its southeastern extremity (Jer. vii. 31; 2 Kings xxiii. 10).
To put an end to these abominations, Josiah polluted the place to render it ceremonially
unclean (2 Kings xxiii. 10, 13, 14; 2 Chron. xxxiv. 4, 5), and it became the common
cesspool of the city, and the laystall where all the solid filth was collected.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_3" id="Endnote_3"></a><a href="#ENanchor_3">[3]—page 16.</a> It is difficult to conceive of the magnificence and the extent of the Temple,
as rebuilt by Herod, one of the greatest royal builders that ever lived. Edersheim
calls it “a palace, a fortress, a sanctuary of shining marble and glittering gold.” Of
it the Jewish tradition ran: “He that has not seen the Temple of Herod, has never
known what beauty is.” As the pilgrim ascended the Mount, crested by that symmetrically
proportioned building, which could hold within its gigantic girdle not fewer than
210,000 persons, his wonder might well increase at every step. The Mount itself
seemed like an island, abruptly rising from out deep valleys, surrounded by a sea of
walls, palaces, streets, and houses, and crowned by a mass of snowy marble and glittering
gold, rising terrace upon terrace. Altogether it measured a square of about one
thousand feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Endnote_4" id="Endnote_4"></a><a href="#ENanchor_4">[4]—page 16.</a> The High Priest was Caiaphas, before whom Jesus had just been on trial.
The beginning of the public ministry of Jesus was contemporaneous with the accession
of Pontius Pilate to the procuratorship and the appointment of Caiaphas by Pilate to the
high priesthood. Under the administration of Pilate, Roman rule reached the deepest
depths in “venality, violence, robbery, persecutions, wanton, malicious insults, judicial
murders without even the formality of a legal process, and cruelty.” History records
of Caiaphas that he was appointed High Priest, not because of his piety—the Talmud
describes in terrible language the “gross self-indulgence, violence, luxury, and even
public indecency” of the high priests of that day—but because in him was found “a
sufficiently submissive instrument of Roman tyranny.” The irreverence here displayed
is the natural expression of an utterly godless nature, and the supernatural events that
centered in that crucifixion hour could not have failed to call forth such manifest feelings
of horror.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_5" id="Endnote_5"></a><a href="#ENanchor_5">[5]—page 18.</a> The supernatural events mentioned in the narrative are recorded by the
evangelists, and confirmed by tradition and contemporaneous history, as having occurred
in connection with the Crucifixion—deep darkness enveloped the earth from the sixth
hour to the ninth hour of the day; the veil of the Temple that shut in the Holy of Holies
was rent from top to bottom; and a mighty earthquake terrified the multitudes. Lange
has well said: “The moment when Christ, the creative Prince, the principle of life to
humanity, and the word, expires, convulses the whole physical world.” Dr. Philip
Schaff has said: “The darkness was designed to exhibit the amazement of nature, and
of the God of nature, at the wickedness of the Crucifixion of Him who is the light of the
world and the sun of righteousness.” The horror from such dense darkness is brought
out powerfully by Lord Byron in his dream of “Darkness.” The extent and character of
the Temple-Veil will account for the fact that it produced so profound an impression
when it was seen rent from top to bottom and hanging in two parts from its fastenings
above and at the side. The Veils before the most Holy Place were sixty feet long, and
thirty wide, of the thickness of the palm of the hand, and wrought in seventy-two
squares joined together. They were so heavy that it was said that three hundred priests
were needed to manipulate them. The rending was seen to be the work of God’s own
hand.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_6" id="Endnote_6"></a><a href="#ENanchor_6">[6]—page 23.</a> The description of the priests and their residences would indicate an ideal
condition. When the Israelites settled in Canaan, Joshua assigned to the priestly families
thirteen cities of residence, with “suburbs” or pasture-grounds for their flocks
(Josh. xxi. 13-19). The Levites were scattered over all the country, but the cities of the
priests were all near Jerusalem and embraced within the bounds of Judah, Simeon, and
Benjamin. When the priests were divided into twenty-four courses, each course officiated
a week at a time. The interval of twenty-three weeks, between the successive
times of service of a course, was a time for home life and high-priestly pursuits. The
opportunities for leisurely culture were undoubtedly very great. In addition to the
large number residing at this time in these priestly cities, who took their turn in the
courses, there were no less than 24,000 stationed permanently at Jerusalem, and 12,000
at Jericho; so that it was a tradition among the Jews “that it had never fallen to the
lot of any priest to offer incense twice.” Their proportion to the number of the people
must, therefore, have been much greater than that of the clergy has ever been in any
Christian nation. Their leisure and opportunities for culture, especially in the Sacred
Books, must have been exceptional. The number of the priestly class was doubtless
increased through intermarriage with the other tribes. Salathiel was a priest, and
hence a Levite; but he was also connected with the tribe of Naphtali, through marriage
of a daughter of that tribe; so that when consciousness returned he found himself being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
borne, not by his priestly associates to the cities of the priests about Jerusalem, but by
his tribal kinsmen to the domain of Naphtali under the shadows of Lebanon.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_7" id="Endnote_7"></a><a href="#ENanchor_7">[7]—page 26.</a> Before the Roman conquest, the hatred of the Samaritan for the Jew
made Samaria largely a land of brigands, through which a Jew could not safely travel.
To Herod the Great belongs the credit of breaking up this brigandage, so far as it was
an organized system. Josephus relates that Herod, after taking Sepphoris, the metropolis
of Galilee, “hasted away to the robbers that were in the caves, who overran a great
part of the country, and did as great mischief to its inhabitants as war itself could have
done.” He defeated them with a great slaughter, and drove them out of the land.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_8" id="Endnote_8"></a><a href="#ENanchor_8">[8]—page 28.</a> The region through which the caravan was passing not only brought
them in view of the scenes of many of the greatest events in Jewish history, individual
and national—Mounts Carmel and Gilboa and Tabor and Hermon, and the theater of
patriarchal and prophetic activity—but across what has been the battle-field for the
armies of the world-empires of three continents as they have crossed and recrossed,
from the days of Abraham down through the Crusades. It is aptly designated “a living
history of Providence.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_9" id="Endnote_9"></a><a href="#ENanchor_9">[9]—page 33.</a> The “Haphtorah” (Isa. liii.) contains the most graphic Old-Testament
picture of Jesus as the rejected, suffering atoning Messiah. It was this that the Ethiopian
eunuch of Queen Candace was reading when Philip went up to him in his chariot
(Acts viii. 29), and by the explanation of which he was converted to the Christian faith.
Through its wonderful picture Eleazar seems already to have been led to look upon
Jesus as the Messiah; but his hopes, roused by Salathiel’s renunciation of the priesthood,
were dashed in finding that the veil was still over the face of the latter, as it
was over the many of Israel.</p>

combining with a sense of wild freedom a touch of the ancient Jewish enthusiasm.
The incident here narrated gives a glimpse of his deeper nature, and his outburst of
patriotic exultation at sight of the grave of the hosts of Sisera was one in which every
true Israelite could join.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_11" id="Endnote_11"></a><a href="#ENanchor_11">[11]—page 47.</a> The life of a whole generation is passed in inactivity after the home is
made in Naphtali—an inactivity that served to deepen the shadow of his doom and the
remorse for his unspeakable crime. In this period the preparation is being made for the
final conflict of Jew with Roman authority, and at the end of it Salathiel is thrust, by a
malevolent power, into the leadership in that desperate first struggle, described by Josephus,
that promised to sweep the Romans from Judea. His fate, however, pursues him,
and he languishes for years in a dungeon—leaving the Jews, now without competent
leadership, again under Roman control and oppression.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_12" id="Endnote_12"></a><a href="#ENanchor_12">[12]—page 51.</a> Antiochus IV., king of Syria—the son of Antiochus the Great—known in
history as Epiphanes the Illustrious, but to many of his contemporaries as Epimanes the
Madman—was for ages the chief name of horror to the Jews. His father had conquered
Palestine, <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 203, and his brother and predecessor, Saleucus Philopator, had plundered
the Temple, and Syria had disputed the control of the land with Egypt. Epiphanes conquered
Jerusalem, <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 169, and held it for three years and a half. The obstinate resistance
of the Jews led to the most dreadful deeds of cruelty recorded in history. Those
who adhered to Ptolemy were mercilessly butchered. He plundered the city and the
Temple. He forbade the Jewish religion, tore up and burned the Sacred Scriptures, put
a stop to the daily Sacrifice of expiation, and dedicated the Temple to Zeus Olympios.
He compelled the people to keep their infants uncircumcised, and to sacrifice swine’s
flesh upon the altar. Kurtz says: “This was the abomination of desolation in the Holy
Place, spoken of by Daniel (ch. xi. 31)—a type of another desolation that still belonged
to the future (Matt. xxiv. 15)”—before the Second Coming of Christ. Added to all the
rest, his system of unspeakable barbarities and horrible tortures at length drove the
people to desperation, and led to the successful uprising and heroic struggle for freedom
under Judas the Maccabee—truly God’s hammer—and his brothers (recorded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
Apocryphal books bearing that name). Help in understanding the Jewish feeling toward
Antiochus may be found in Josephus, Prideaux, Edersheim, etc.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_13" id="Endnote_13"></a><a href="#ENanchor_13">[13]—page 61.</a> Eleazar, as he appears in the narrative, is not the real name of a historic
leader of the Jews at this time. Josephus, indeed, speaks of a certain Jew “who
was called Eleazar, and was born at Saab, in Galilee. This man took up a stone of great
size, and threw it down from the wall upon the ram, and this with so great a force that
it broke off the head of the engine. He also leaped down and took up the head of the
ram from the midst of them, and, without any concern, carried it to the top of the wall,
and this, while he stood as a fit mark to be pelted by all his enemies.” Disregarding
his many wounds, he showed himself a hero in other daring exploits, like some of those
attributed by the author to Salathiel.</p>

<p>Josephus tells also of another Eleazar, who, at the time when the Jews took the fortress
of Masada by treachery, was the governor of the Temple. He was the son of Ananias,
the High Priest, and was a very bold youth. He “persuaded those that officiated
in the divine service to receive no gift or sacrifice from any foreigner. And this,” adds
Josephus, “was the true beginning of our war with the Romans; for they rejected
the sacrifice of Cæsar on this account.”</p>

<p>The real leader in this early Jewish war was, however, Flavius Josephus, the historian.
After the destruction of the army of Cestius Gallus in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 66, the patriots precipitated
a revolution, and Josephus was sent to organize the defense of Galilee. He led in the
desperate struggle against Vespasian, but fell into the hands of the Romans after the
fall of the stronghold of Jotapata and the subsequent massacre there. He saved himself
by predicting the future elevation of Vespasian to the imperial throne. He was present
in the Roman army at the destruction of Jerusalem, and accompanied Titus to Rome,
where he resided for the rest of his life. He was a great leader, and Salathiel in his
exploits often seems to personate him.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_14" id="Endnote_14"></a><a href="#ENanchor_14">[14]—page 64.</a> Onias is not brought forward as a historical character, but as the representative
of a class of Jews who were equally treacherous in their dealings with their
patriotic countrymen and with the Romans. He appears as one of the marplots of the
history—the personification of hatred and malice—from this council of war until the final
catastrophe, when he dies by the hand of Jubal. The speech which the writer puts in
his mouth was, however, undoubtedly suggested by the remarkable oration, recorded by
Josephus (Bk. II., ch. xvi.), which Agrippa (the same mentioned in the Acts) addressed to
the Jews, in the gallery adjoining the Temple and in the presence of his sister Bernice,
who was above in the palace of the Asmoneans, and in which he sought to dissuade the
people from going to war with their oppressors. In this speech of Agrippa we have
“an authentic account of the extent and strength of the Roman empire when the Jewish
war began,” from which becomes the more apparent the madness that hurried the
Jews to their final destruction.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_15" id="Endnote_15"></a><a href="#ENanchor_15">[15]—page 70.</a> In these foreglimpses of national doom, the representative character of
Salathiel is brought out and the sense of his own personal doom, as the arch-crucifier
of Jesus, deepened.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_16" id="Endnote_16"></a><a href="#ENanchor_16">[16]—page 72.</a> It has often been remarked that the selection of Judea as the home of
the chosen people bears the marks of divine wisdom. At the point where the three
continents of the ancient world meet, surrounded by desert, mountain, and sea,
broken by rugged ranges and defiles impassable in the face of even a small opposing
force, and filled with a dense population, it was not only unique in character but
impregnable to foreign foe so long as Israel remained faithful to its covenant with
Jehovah. When the barriers, which at first excluded the people from the outside world
in their earlier development, were broken down, it became the one place from which
all the world was most accessible for the spread of the Hebrew Theism and of Christianity.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_17" id="Endnote_17"></a><a href="#ENanchor_17">[17]—page 74.</a> The Year of Jubilee, recurring every fiftieth year, was a remarkable
feature of the Jewish system. It was inaugurated on the Day of Atonement with the
blowing of trumpets throughout the land, and by a proclamation of universal liberty.
Its main provisions were: (1) The soil was left uncultivated and the chance produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
was free to all comers. (2) Every Israelite recovered his right to the land originally
allotted to the family to which he belonged, if he, or his ancestor, had parted with it.
Houses in walled cities were an exception, altho these were redeemable at any time
within a full year of the time of sale. (3) All Israelites who had become slaves, either
to their own countrymen or to resident foreigners, were set free in the Jubilee.
Josephus states that in his time all debts were remitted in the Year of Jubilee. It
was a wonderful provision for preventing the accumulation of inordinate wealth in the
hands of the few, and for relieving and giving new opportunity to those whom misfortune
or fault had reduced to poverty. (See Smith’s Bible Dictionary.)</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_18" id="Endnote_18"></a><a href="#ENanchor_18">[18]—page 75.</a> Small as was Judea—no larger than one of our smaller States—it yet has
the distinction of embracing within its bounds the temperatures and productions of all
climes. Notwithstanding the covenant unfaithfulness of its people and their failure in
obedience to Jehovah, it is still true that it bequeathed to mankind all the forms of Theism—Judaism,
Christianity, and Mohammedanism—and with and through them the chief
enlightening and power-giving influences since operative among the nations. It is not,
then, too much to say that, with faithfulness to God and to its unequaled privileges,
“Judea might have changed the earth into a paradise.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_19" id="Endnote_19"></a><a href="#ENanchor_19">[19]—page 79.</a> The elevation of Salathiel to the leadership, as the Prince of Naphtali,
in the war now decided upon, seems contrary to the natural order, as he was a priest
and allied to the tribe of Naphtali by marriage merely; but the plea that it was a holy
war prevailed, and the superhuman qualities that had been manifested in him clearly
marked him for the position. The exaltation and exultation were to be simply the
prelude to a sharp recall to a deeper sense of the curse that was upon him, and upon
all else because of his crime.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_20" id="Endnote_20"></a><a href="#ENanchor_20">[20]—page 84.</a> The blow was a critical one for Judea, depriving it of its leader at the
moment when that leader was most needed. It likewise dashed the high hopes of the
leader and left him a madman, a prey to the wildest imagination that swept him
through earth and sky, leaving him at last, for periods beyond all counting, the sleepless,
conscious, vivid victim of misery unspeakable.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_21" id="Endnote_21"></a><a href="#ENanchor_21">[21]—page 93.</a> The grove known as the Cedars of Lebanon consists of about 400 trees,
standing in a depression of the mountain, quite apart from all other trees. The trees are
about 6,500 feet above the sea, and 3,000 below the summit. About 37 of these are large
and old, the 11 or 12 older ones being of immense size and each spreading itself widely
round from several trunks, and reaching back in time 3,500 and more years—beyond
Solomon and Abraham. They are naturally looked upon with much reverence by the
natives of the region as living records of the glory of Solomon. The Maronite patriarch
was formerly accustomed to celebrate there the festival of the Transfiguration at an
altar of rough stones. In later years a chapel has been erected on the spot. The references
of the author are to an earlier, and usually idolatrous, worship. Bands of robbers,
such as that described, naturally sought the vicinity of such gatherings.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_22" id="Endnote_22"></a><a href="#ENanchor_22">[22]—page 97.</a> The worship of the robbers at Lebanon illustrates the ease with which
the Oriental mind conjoins religion with any form of villainy. This, however, is likely
to be a feature of any religion that is a mere superstition.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_23" id="Endnote_23"></a><a href="#ENanchor_23">[23]—page 103.</a> These Greek Christian hermits, dwelling apart from men in their
rocky cavern, are a fair type of thousands of such bands, driven by the terrible persecutions
of the Roman Emperor to take refuge in the bowels of the earth. They were often
made up of the noblest and best of souls that most readily responded to the call and the
ideal of Christianity. A similar state continued during much of the time until, in the
age of Constantine, the Christians became so numerous as to be able to change from a
policy of inaction to one of aggressive self-defense.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_24" id="Endnote_24"></a><a href="#ENanchor_24">[24]—page 113.</a> History records the facts of Roman corruption and degeneracy during
this period. During the absence of Salathiel, the oppression and extortion had maddened
the Jews and reached a point beyond endurance. There resulted a succession of
partial and premature uprisings. The empire everywhere seemed falling into decay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
and preparing for dissolution; the evils and the evil line of rulers culminated in the
administration of Gessius Florus.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_25" id="Endnote_25"></a><a href="#ENanchor_25">[25]—page 133.</a> It was Gessius Florus who, by his barbarity in governing, finally forced
the Jews into war. Josephus, contrasting him with Albinus, pictures Florus as a human
monster: “Altho such was the character of Albinus, yet did Gessius Florus, who
succeeded him, demonstrate him to have been a most excellent person, upon the comparison;
for the former did the greatest part of his rogueries in private, and with a
sort of dissimulation; but Gessius did his unjust actions to the harm of the nation after
a pompous manner; and as tho he had been sent as an executioner to punish condemned
malefactors, he omitted no sort of rapine, or of vexation; where the case was
really pitiable he was most barbarous, and in things of the greatest turpitude he was
most impudent. Nor could any one outdo him in disguising the truth, nor could any one
contrive more subtle ways of deceit than he did. He indeed thought it but a petty
offense to get money out of simple persons; so he spoiled whole cities and ruined entire
bodies of men at once, and did almost publicly proclaim it all the country over that they
had liberty given them to turn robbers, upon this condition: that he might go shares
with them in the spoils they got. Accordingly, this, his greediness of gain, was the
occasion that entire toparchies were brought to desolation, and a great many of the
people left their own country and fled into foreign provinces.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_26" id="Endnote_26"></a><a href="#ENanchor_26">[26]—page 145.</a> In the Prophet Daniel’s vision the Roman world-empire was represented
by iron, which dashed and broke in pieces all else. It is the wont to say that
Rome had a genius for conquest and empire. Among the nations she represented
power and law, as Greece represented culture and Judea religion. The Roman was
lacking in the culture and religion needed to refine and control his rugged nature; hence,
his drift toward the animal and brutal, and toward the outward show of life. Corruption
was already far on its way, and was only delayed for a time by the spread and
prevalence of the Christian faith.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_27" id="Endnote_27"></a><a href="#ENanchor_27">[27]—page 147.</a> Nero was Emperor from <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 54 to <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 68. He was a nephew of
Caligula, and was adopted by Claudius in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 50. Even his own age, which had borne
and nurtured him, regarded him in his later career a monster. He killed those whom
he feared, among them his own mother and Britannicus, the son of Claudius, and rightful
heir to the throne; those who stood in the way of his whims, as his first two wives,
Octavia and Poppæa Sabina; and at last he killed everybody who attracted his attention.
Under him occurred the insurrection of the Jews, put down by Vespasian, in which
Josephus so ably led his countrymen. The conflagration in July, 64, in which two-thirds
of Rome was destroyed, is believed to have been the work of Nero, who is said to have
shown his indifference by playing the “Siege of Troy” on his fiddle while watching the
flames from a high tower in his palace. He wantonly accused the Christians of setting
it on fire, and sentenced them to be clad in tarred garments, set on fire, and driven as
flaming torches through the streets of Rome. A conspiracy formed against him in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
65 failed, and he sacrificed his old instructor, Seneca, and the philosopher’s nephew,
the poet Lucan, the author of “Pharsalia”; but one formed in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 68, extending over
Gaul, Spain, and Rome itself, overwhelmed the tyrant on his return from a journey in
Greece, where he had appeared as a singer on the stage, and drove him to despair and
to suicide in June of that year.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_28" id="Endnote_28"></a><a href="#ENanchor_28">[28]—page 149.</a> “Married, but not mated,” could not have been said of Nero, at least
in the later years of his life. He had early married Octavia, the daughter of Claudius,
his adopted father; but afterward became enslaved by the charms of a mistress, Acte,
a beautiful freedwoman, who was content to be merely the Emperor’s plaything. In
the year 58, Poppæa Sabina took the place of Acte. The new favorite was not satisfied,
however, to be merely the plaything of Nero; she was resolved to be his wife. With
consummate skill she set herself at once to remove the obstacles that stood in her way.
By playing upon the passions and fears of Nero she accomplished her diabolical purposes.
She wrought him up to a passion of hatred against Agrippina, his mother, and
she was murdered. The trusted advisers of the Emperor were one by one made way
with. Octavia, his wife, daughter of Claudius, now long neglected, was divorced, banished,
and barbarously murdered. Poppæa’s triumph was now complete. “She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
formally married to Nero; her head appeared on the coins side by side with his; and
her statue appeared in the public places of Rome.” Her career shows her to have been
anything but a “dove in a vulture’s talons.” Poppæa died in the autumn of the year
65, just after the great conflagration, and a little before the great pestilence consequent
upon it.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_29" id="Endnote_29"></a><a href="#ENanchor_29">[29]—page 160.</a> The dying appeal of the martyr St. Paul—whose name is not mentioned—is

subjects in secular romances.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_30" id="Endnote_30"></a><a href="#ENanchor_30">[30]—page 173.</a> The account given by the historian Tacitus, in his “Annals,” of the
origin of the Christians, of their persecution, and of the satiating of the popular rage, is
of peculiar interest as illustrating this narrative. Of the Christians, Tacitus says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This name was derived from one ‘Christus,’ who was executed in the reign of
Tiberius by the procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate; and this accursed superstition, for
a moment repressed, broke forth again, not only through Judea, the source of evil, but
even through the city, whither all things outrageous and shameful flow together and
find many adherents. Accordingly those were first arrested who confessed, afterward
a vast number upon their information, who were convicted, not so much on the charge
of causing the fire, as for their hatred to the human race. To their execution there
were added such mockeries as that they were wrapped in the skins of wild beasts and
torn in pieces by dogs, or crucified, or set on fire and burnt, when daylight ended, as
torches by night. Nero lent his own gardens for the spectacle, and gave a chariot race,
at which he mingled freely with the multitude in the garb of a driver or mounted on
his chariot. As the result of all, a feeling of compassion arose for the sufferers, tho
guilty and deserving of condign punishment, on the ground that they were destroyed
not for the common good, but to gratify the cruelty of one man.”</p>

</div>

<p><a name="Endnote_31" id="Endnote_31"></a><a href="#ENanchor_31">[31]—page 187.</a> “Unconquerable fortresses” proclaimed the name and sway of Herod
the Great. Among these were Essebonitis and Machærus in Peræa, and Alexandreian,
Herodion, Hyrcania, and Masada in Southeastern Judea, near the shore of the Dead
Sea. According to the description of Masada by Josephus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There was a rock not small in circumference, and very high. It was encompassed
with valleys of such vast depth downward that the eye could not reach their bottoms;
they were abrupt, and such as no animal could walk upon, excepting at two places of
the rock, where it subsides, in order to afford a passage for ascent, tho not without
difficulty. Now, of the ways that lead to it, one is that from the Lake Asphaltitis,
toward the sun-rising, and another on the west, where the ascent is easier; the one of
these ways called the Serpent, as resembling that animal in its narrowness and its perpetual
windings; for it is broken off at the prominent precipice of the rock, and returns
frequently into itself, and lengthening again by little and little, hath much ado to
proceed forward; and he that would walk along it must first go on one leg, and then on
the other; there is also nothing but destruction in case your feet slip; for on each side
there is a vastly deep chasm and precipice, sufficient to quell the courage of everybody
by the terror it infuses into the mind. When, therefore, a man had gone along this
way for thirty furlongs, the rest is the top of the hill, not ending at a small point, but is
no other than a plain upon the highest part of the mountain. Upon this top of the hill,
Jonathan, the High Priest, first of all built a fortress and called it Masada; after which
the rebuilding of this place employed the care of King Herod to a great degree.”</p>

</div>

<p><a name="Endnote_32" id="Endnote_32"></a><a href="#ENanchor_32">[32]—page 233.</a> It was in Masada that Herod the Great, when he fled to Rome to appeal
to Antony, had left his mother, sister, and children. In later years, after he had been
established in the kingdom by order of Rome, he rebuilt, strengthened, and beautified
the fortress. Soon after Florus, by his extortion and cruelty, had driven the Jews to
rebellion, history records that Masada was taken by surprise, and the Roman garrison
put to the sword. This is the historical basis of this chapter of the story.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_33" id="Endnote_33"></a><a href="#ENanchor_33">[33]—page 247.</a> Josephus follows his description of the fortress of Masada by an
account of Herod’s palace, that justifies the description here given, and reveals the
motive of the king in its construction:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Moreover, he built a palace therein at the western ascent; it was within and beneath
the walls of the citadel, but inclined to its north side. Now the wall of this palace was
very high and strong, and had at its four corners towers sixty cubits high. The furniture,
also, of the edifices, and of the cloisters, and of the baths, was of great variety and was
very costly; and these buildings were supported by pillars of single stones on every side;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
the walls also, and the floors of the edifices were paved with stones of several colors.…
As for the furniture that was within this fortress, it was still more wonderful, on
account of its splendor and long continuance.… There was also found here a large
quantity of all sorts of weapons of war, which had been treasured up by that king, and
were sufficient for ten thousand men; there were cast-iron, and brass, and tin: which
show that he had taken much pains to have all things here ready for the greatest occasions;
for the report goes, how Herod thus prepared this fortress on his own account, as
a refuge against two kinds of danger: the one for fear of the multitude of the Jews,
lest they should depose him, and restore their former kings to the government; the
other danger was greater and more terrible, which arose from Cleopatra, queen of
Egypt, who did not conceal her intentions, but spake often to Antony, and desired him
to cut off Herod, and entreated him to bestow the kingdom of Judea upon her. And
certainly it is a great wonder that Antony did never comply with her commands in this
point, as he was so miserably enslaved to his passion for her; nor should any one have
been surprised if she had been gratified in such her request. So the fear of these
dangers made Herod rebuild Masada, and thereby leave it for the finishing stroke of
the Romans in this Jewish war.”</p>

</div>

<p><a name="Endnote_34" id="Endnote_34"></a><a href="#ENanchor_34">[34]—page 253.</a> The record of history at the basis of this part of the narrative is, that
immediately after the capture of Masada, “Manahem—a younger son of the celebrated
Judas of Galilee, who had perished in a revolt soon after the exile of Archelaus, leaving
to a powerful party the watchword, ‘We have no king but God,’—proclaimed himself
the leader of the zealots and marched upon Jerusalem. The outworks of the palace
were mined and burned, and the garrison capitulated. The Jews and the troops of
Agrippa were allowed to depart; the Roman soldiers retired to the three strong towers
built by Herod, and all left in the palace were put to death. The success was followed
by the execution of the High Priest Ananias and his brother, who were found hidden
in an aqueduct; but these and other excesses displeased the people; and when Manahem
proceeded to assume the royal diadem, he was put to death by the partizans of Eleazar.
In him the insurgents lost the only hope of a competent leader. The Roman soldiers in
the towers were soon compelled to surrender on promise of their lives; but they had no
sooner piled their arms than they were cut to pieces. This baptism of blood, by which
the zealots committed themselves to a war of extermination, which they at the same
time deprived of the dignity of a patriotic struggle, was perpetrated on a Sabbath; and
on the same day the Jews of Cæsarea were massacred by the Greeks to the number of
20,000. These deeds mark the character of the conflict, not only as an insurrection of
Judea against the Romans, but as an internecine struggle of the Jewish and Greek
races in Palestine and the neighboring lands.”—<cite>Philip Smith</cite>, “History of the World.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_35" id="Endnote_35"></a><a href="#ENanchor_35">[35]—page 254.</a> These Mosaic regulations for exemption from war are found in
Deut. xx. They are unique and peculiar to the Jewish code.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_36" id="Endnote_36"></a><a href="#ENanchor_36">[36]—page 263.</a> The historian records that the capture of Jerusalem brought down the
Romans upon the insurgents:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Cestius Gallus, the governor of Syria, set his forces in motion, with the forces of
Agrippa, who had now openly taken the Roman side, and other allies, added to his
Roman legions. He advanced upon Jerusalem through the pass of Bethhoron, at the
season of the Feast of Tabernacles, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 66, with an army of 25,000 men. Regardless
alike of the feast and of the Sabbath, the Jews rushed out to meet the enemy on the spot
consecrated by the victories of Joshua and Judas Maccabeus; crushed the Roman van
with the slaughter of more than 500 men, and with a loss of only 22. A charge
of light troops on the Jewish rear saved the army of Cestius from destruction, and gave
him time to entrench his camp, and the Jews were obliged to retire to Jerusalem.”
Cestius then advanced and encamped at Scopus, a mile to the north of the city. After
five days of irregular attacks, he advanced against the northern wall of the Temple and
began the work of mining; but, notwithstanding encouragements from the factions in
the city, he suddenly and unaccountably withdrew, and, after a night’s rest on Scopus,
“commenced his retreat with the hostile population gathering round him at every step,
and reached Gabas with loss. Here the beasts of burden were killed and the baggage
abandoned. As soon as the Romans had entered the pass of Bethhoron, they were
assailed in flank and rear and the passage blocked in front. Night alone saved them
from utter destruction; and Cestius, displaying the standards and leaving 400 men, to
make a show of defending the empty camp, fled with the remnant of his army, pursued
by the Jews as far as Antipatris. He lost 5,300 foot and 380 horses; and the engines of
war, which he had carried up for the siege of Jerusalem, became an invaluable help to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
its defense. Having secured this prize, and collected the immense booty, the Jews
returned to the city with hymns of triumph, fancying that the days of the Maccabees
had returned, and forgetting that the power they had defied wielded the resources of
the whole civilized world, while they had forfeited the aid of Omnipotence.”—<cite>Philip
Smith.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><a name="Endnote_37" id="Endnote_37"></a><a href="#ENanchor_37">[37]—page 276.</a> It was during this interval, in which the Jews were without competent
leadership, that the Romans made and carried forward their plans for conquering
Judea. The news of the revolt and the defeat of Cestius reached Nero when he was on
his theatrical tour of Greece. He at once entrusted Vespasian (afterward Emperor)
with the command of all the forces of Syria and the East. Vespasian immediately “sent
his son Titus to Alexandria, to lead the fifteenth legion into Palestine, while he hastened
through Asia Minor and Syria, collecting troops and engines as he advanced. In the
spring of the following year, three legions, with a large force of allies, were assembled
at Ptolemais (Acre). The sense of being committed to so great a conflict, and the six-months’
interval for preparation, had restored some order among the still divided Jews.
The avowed friends of Rome had either taken refuge with her armies or been compelled
to join the insurgents.” So writes the historian. In the interval the moderate
party, who would have been content to acknowledge the supremacy of Rome if their
liberties were secured, had, by their numbers and character, obtained the ascendency
over the zealots.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_38" id="Endnote_38"></a><a href="#ENanchor_38">[38]—page 280.</a> Jubal appears in this strange manner, after two years had been passed
in the dungeon, and rehearses the story of the war. The attack of Vespasian fell first
upon Galilee, which lay in his way to Jerusalem. The moderate party had placed
Joseph, the son of Matthias—better known as the author of “Jewish Antiquities,” and
by his Roman name, Flavius Josephus, which he later assumed, as the client of Vespasian in
command in Galilee. His account given in “The Jewish War” proves that
the horrors of the conflict in Galilee were not overdrawn by Jubal. Josephus, who was
undoubtedly possessed of military genius of no mean order, was driven at last to stake
the fate of Galilee on the defense of Jotapata. Before it Vespasian was wounded, but
the hill-fortress was finally stormed. The story of the marvelous escape of the Jewish
leader and of his recapture is related by himself. He was thereafter attached to the
suite of Vespasian “in a character between a prisoner and a companion; and, after
acting throughout the war as a mediator between his countrymen and the Romans, he
was rewarded with a grant of land in Judea, together with a pension and the Roman
franchise.” Some of the most interesting features in Dr. Croly’s romance would seem
to have been suggested by experiences in the life of Josephus. The horrors of the war
were indescribable. Toward the close of the Galilean campaign, Trajan was despatched
by Vespasian to seize Joppa, the only port held by the Jews. “Here the unfortunate
inhabitants took to their ships, which were dashed to pieces by a storm, and the few
survivors killed by the Romans as they gained the land. At the other captured cities
(Tiberias, Taricheia, Gamala, Itabyrium, and Gischala) all the elder inhabitants were
massacred and the younger sold as slaves. Never was a war marked by greater atrocities
on both sides than that which now desolated the Holy Land.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_39" id="Endnote_39"></a><a href="#ENanchor_39">[39]—page 284.</a> The numerous caves, owing to the chalky limestone of which the rocks
of Syria and Palestine chiefly consist, are one of the marked features of this region.
The Scriptures are full of references to them, as they were used for dwelling-places,
burial-places, places of refuge, and other purposes. The bold shores of the Mediterranean,
affording as they do so little good harborage, are well suited to furnish caverns,
approachable from the sea only, in which the robber band is represented as holding its
orgies.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_40" id="Endnote_40"></a><a href="#ENanchor_40">[40]—page 291.</a> Such a robber group was not uncommon in that age, made up as it was
of such diverse races and dispositions. The corruption of the Roman rule under Nero
brought an approach to anarchy in many of the provinces. Owing to the favorable
character of its topography and the strange mixture of its population, Palestine, and
indeed the whole Syrian shore of the Mediterranean, was at the worst in this regard.
Robbery, by sea and by land, was so widely practised as to gather to itself a degree of
respectability not usually associated with it. German, Chiote, Syrian, Arab, Egyptian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
and Ethiopian, all develop here in the most marked way, under the influence of over-much
wine, their national idiosyncrasies and their natural quarrelsomeness.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_41" id="Endnote_41"></a><a href="#ENanchor_41">[41]—page 328.</a> This chance meeting with Naomi, the granddaughter of Ananus, the
late High Priest, furnishes the key to many of the situations and strange adventures of
the closing volume of this romance. It was during the period of Salathiel’s incarceration
in the dungeon, and while Vespasian was pushing on to Jerusalem, that the death
of Ananus occurred. Josephus represents Ananus, or Annus, as a man who might
have saved the nation from destruction. At this time he shared the supreme power in
Jerusalem, under the Sanhedrin, with Simon, the son of Garion, the bravest of the
zealots, the moderate party being thus the controlling power in the city. Later, however,
when the tide of devastation directed by Vespasian had entirely swept over Galilee
and Perea, the death of Nero brought a brief respite until Vespasian himself had
been chosen Emperor. Meanwhile the efforts of Ananus to make preparation for
defense were paralyzed by the zealots. The historian relates how “Jerusalem became
the refuge and sink of the fugitives from every quarter. Crowds brought fresh confusion,
and added to the fatal power of the zealots. At length John of Giscala arrived,
with his panting men and horses, from the fall of the last Galilean fortress. In spite
of the tale which their appearance told, the crafty leader announced that the Romans
were exhausted, and pointed to the long resistance of the northern cities as a presage
of their failure before Jerusalem. His arrival animated the zealots; and the robbers
and assassins who had come into the city from every quarter enacted scenes which are
only paralleled by the September massacres of Paris in 1792.” Ananus set himself
against this sacrilegious reign of terror, but the zealots prevailed, and he was put to
death, and his naked corpse “thrown out to the dogs and vultures, in a land where it
was a sacred custom to bury even the worst malefactors before sunset. The moderate
party was crushed, and the zealots followed up their triumph, first by a series of massacres,
in which, says Josephus, ‘they slaughtered the people like a herd of unclean
animals,’ to the number of 12,000, and then by murders under the form of law.” Faction
then ran riot as the doomed city awaited the coming of Titus, who succeeded his
father Vespasian, for its final destruction.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_42" id="Endnote_42"></a><a href="#ENanchor_42">[42]—page 347.</a> When Vespasian was made Emperor, he departed for Rome, leaving
Titus to work the wrath of God upon the doomed city—doomed because of unfaithfulness
to its covenant with Jehovah. Early in the year 70, Titus, having collected his
forces at Cæsarea, moved upon Jerusalem with not less than 80,000 men, arriving before
the city when, at the last Passover ever celebrated, it was crammed, as Josephus relates,
with a million persons keeping that feast and without any provision having been made
for their sustenance. The garrison of the Holy City was made up of three principal
factions, as ready to fight with one another as with the Roman. Eleazar, the leader of
one faction of the zealots, with 2,400 men, held the Temple and four strong towers that
had been erected at its corners. John of Giscala, leader of a mediating party, had succeeded
to the position of Ananus in the Temple courts and the lower city, and with
6,000 men besieged Eleazar’s forces. Simon, son of Gioras, occupied the hill of Zion
with 10,000 Jews and 5,000 Idumeans, and confronted both the other leaders. Titus
found these factions carrying on an incessant fight with one another by means of the
war-engines left behind by Cestius in his flight. With such a state of things existing,
there could be little hope of defense against the conquerors of the world.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_43" id="Endnote_43"></a><a href="#ENanchor_43">[43]—page 353.</a> The Prince arrived after Titus had pushed the siege far on toward
completion. The historian records that on the first day of the feast, the Jewish leaders
for a moment suspended their mutual hostilities to make a combined attack upon the
single legion stationed on the Mount of Olives. The Romans, at work on their entrenchments,
were suddenly beset by hosts that kept pouring out of the city, and were driven
back to the summit of the hill; but by a desperate effort they at last succeeded in beating
them back. On the next day, the second of the feast, the factions renewed the internal
conflict, and the party of John gained possession of the Temple; and thus the
factions were reduced to two.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_44" id="Endnote_44"></a><a href="#ENanchor_44">[44]—page 356.</a> The Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem alone formed an exception to
the judicial blindness that had fallen upon Israel. Warned by the prophecy of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
(Luke xxi. 20, 21), they had departed in a body, before the city was surrounded, to
Pella, a village of Decapolis, beyond the Jordan.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_45" id="Endnote_45"></a><a href="#ENanchor_45">[45]—page 360.</a> When the siege at length shut in the city, it was no longer possible to
furnish the priests or the offerings for the daily sacrifice twice a day for the sins of the
people; hence when it ceased, on the 17th of the month Tamuz, the universal horror of
a people undone expressing itself in a universal outcry. Concerning the cessation of
the daily sacrifice, Whiston, the translator and editor of Josephus, has the following
note: “This was a remarkable day indeed, the 17th of Panemus (Tamuz), <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 70,
when, according to Daniel’s prediction, six hundred and six years before, the Romans,
in half a week, caused the sacrifice and oblation to cease (Dan. ix. 27). For from the
month of February <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 66, about which time Vespasian entered on this war, to this
very time, was just three years and a half.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_46" id="Endnote_46"></a><a href="#ENanchor_46">[46]—page 367.</a> The historical record is that, on April 13 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 70, when Titus advanced
in person at the head of six hundred cavalry to reconnoiter the city, not a man
was to be seen; but as he rode incautiously near the wall, he was suddenly surrounded
by a multitude that poured out from a gate behind him. Bareheaded and without a
breastplate, he forced his way through the hosts with his horse and sword, amid a
storm of darts that transfixed many of his followers, and, tho he escaped unharmed to
the camp, the Jews could boast that the first act of the siege was Cæsar’s flight.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_47" id="Endnote_47"></a><a href="#ENanchor_47">[47]—page 378.</a> What with faction within and assault from without, the wretchedness
of Jerusalem at this time had become almost inconceivable. The historian graphically
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Soon there was literally a battle for life within the city. The weak and the starving
had their last morsels of food snatched from them by the strong; and the strong were
tortured and executed because their looks convicted them of having a concealed store.
‘Every kind feeling, love, respect, natural affection, was extinct through the all-absorbing
want. Wives would snatch the last morsel from husbands, children from parents,
mothers from children; they would intercept even their own milk from the lips of their
pining babes.’ If we are allowed to doubt whether Josephus has exaggerated these horrors,
we may be sure that his picture of the cruelties of his imperial patron is but too
true. As the famine became more intolerable, so did the measures of Titus to force the
people to surrender. Wretches who prowled outside the walls during the night, to pick
up scraps of food, were scourged and crucified, sometimes to the number of five hundred
at a time, and twisted into ludicrous postures by the wantonness of the soldiers; the
soldiers bade those that desired peace to behold these examples of Roman mercy.”</p>

</div>

<p><a name="Endnote_48" id="Endnote_48"></a><a href="#ENanchor_48">[48]—page 387.</a> It is to the honor of Titus that he made earnest and repeated efforts to
save the Temple as well as to prevent its desecration by the Jews themselves. After
the destruction of Antonia and before his final assault upon the defenses of the Temple,
he made a last experiment of clemency. According to the historian, many accepted his
offer of mercy; and when the rest had fled to Zion and the Temple, he sent to Josephus
to offer them free egress if they would come out and fight, rather than see the sanctuary
polluted. His words, uttered in their own language, were beginning to make some
impression, when his old enemy, John, sternly interrupted him, declaring that he feared
not the taking of the city, for God would protect His own: and Josephus narrowly escaped
capture. The captives just admitted to quarter, including many of the chief
priests, next appeared before the Temple gate to entreat the zealots to save the house of
God from ruin; but the merciless John, who had already butchered many of their relatives,
answered with a shower of missiles, which—says Josephus—strewed the ground
with bodies as thickly as the places where the slaves were thrown out unburied. Titus
himself pleaded the inconsistency of filling with arms and blood the courts of the Holy
Place, nay, even the Holy of Holies, which they had always guarded with jealousy. “I
call on your gods,” said he, “I call on my whole army—I call on the Jews who are with
me—I call on yourselves—to witness that I do not force you to this crime. Come forth,
and fight in any other place, and no Roman shall violate your sacred edifice.” But the
zealots, in their judicial blindness, rejected all offers of mercy, and waited for God to
save the Temple by miracle.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_49" id="Endnote_49"></a><a href="#ENanchor_49">[49]—page 409.</a> The historian records that the year preceding the final revolt (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 65)
was marked by the direst prodigies of impending war and of the desolation of the Temple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
During a whole year, a comet shaped like a simitar hung over the city, and many
an eye-witness testified to the appearance described by Milton:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“As when, to warn proud cities, war appears</div>
<div class="verse">Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush</div>
<div class="verse">To battle in the clouds; before each van</div>
<div class="verse">Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears,</div>
<div class="verse">Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms</div>
<div class="verse">From either end of heaven the welkin burns.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Those who witnessed the splendid comet of Donati (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1858) will at once be able to
recognize the form of the flaming sword across the sky.</p>

<p>“The brazen gate of the Temple, which required twenty men to move it on its hinges,
flew open of its own accord in the dead of night, as if to let in the advancing armies of
the heathen.” (See Philip Smith.)</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_50" id="Endnote_50"></a><a href="#ENanchor_50">[50]—page 419.</a> The doom of the Holy City had been rendered inevitable by the conduct
of the people in forsaking their covenant with Jehovah. The Evangelist Luke
(xix. 41-44) represents Jesus as pausing as He approached the city, and shedding bitter
tears over the remedilessness of the fate of the city and people. The passage is of interest
on account, not only of this weeping, but also of the prophecy so remarkably fulfilled
by Titus. The words of the Gospel are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, If thou
hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy
peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that
thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in
on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee;
and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the
time of thy visitation.”</p>

</div>

<p><a name="Endnote_51" id="Endnote_51"></a><a href="#ENanchor_51">[51]—page 428.</a> It will be remembered that when Titus gathered his forces at Cæsarea
for an advance upon Jerusalem, he drew from Alexandria, Egyptian and Ethiopian
troops.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_52" id="Endnote_52"></a><a href="#ENanchor_52">[52]—page 446.</a> The loss of life among the Jews during the siege of Jerusalem was almost
incredible. Josephus reckoned it at 1,100,000, a number not difficult to credit if
we remember that “nearly the whole male population of Judea had been gathered together
for the Passover when the city was beleaguered. The prisoners taken in the
whole war were 90,000.” Had it not been for the Jews of the dispersion, the nation
would have perished with the city. It was due to the compassion of Titus that a movement
that might have destroyed even this remnant was stopped almost at its inception.
When persecution of the Jews began at Antioch, where several Jews were put
to death for an alleged plot to set fire to the city, from which it would probably have
spread over the empire, Titus put an end to it by his famous order and rebuke: “The
country of the Jews is destroyed, thither they can not return; it would be hard to allow
them no home to retreat to; leave them in peace.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_53" id="Endnote_53"></a><a href="#ENanchor_53">[53]—page 459.</a> By his Roman prenomen, Titus, is usually known Titus Flavius Sabinus
Vespasianus, the eleventh of the twelve Cæsars, Emperor from 79 to 81 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> He was in
some respects one of the most remarkable of the Cæsars. “Educated in the imperial
court, he was thoroughly trained in all elegant accomplishments: he could speak Greek
fluently, and could compose verses; he was proficient in music; he could write short-hand,
and could imitate handwriting so skilfully that he used to say that he might have
been a most successful forger. He was very handsome, with a fine commanding expression
and a vigorous frame, well trained in all the exercises of a soldier.” His long
and varied military and executive experience, under the guidance of his father Vespasian
and especially in the Jewish war, made him a consummate warrior and administrator.
For a time, however, after he became formally associated with his father in the
government, with the title of Cæsar, and practically controlled the administration during
the last nine years of Vespasian’s reign, he developed “the character of being luxurious,
self-indulgent, profligate, and cruel,” and seemed to have in himself the promise
of being a second Nero. The scandal connecting his name with the shameless beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
Berenice, the sister of the Agrippa of the Acts of the Apostles, outraged public opinion
at Rome, but ended in his sending her back to the East.</p>

<p>The death of Vespasian, in 79 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, wrought a transformation in Titus, and he became
known as the “love and delight of mankind.” “He had the tact to make himself liked
by all. He seems to have been thoroughly kindly and good-natured; he delighted in
giving splendid presents, and his memorable saying, ‘I have lost a day,’ is said to have
been uttered one evening at the dinner-table when he suddenly remembered that he
had not bestowed a gift on any one that day.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_54" id="Endnote_54"></a><a href="#ENanchor_54">[54]—page 467.</a> The fine portrait here drawn of Titus Flavius Vespasianus, the tenth of
the Twelve Cæsars, known in history as Vespasian, is in striking contrast with that
previously sketched of his son Titus. The father had little of the princely and imposing
personality of the son. He was a thoroughly able soldier, while simple and frugal in
his habits; in short, Tacitus says that “but for his avarice he was equal to the generals
of old days.” A better judgment, however, would probably attribute the avarice, with
which both Tacitus and Suetonius stigmatize him, to “an enlightened economy, which,
in the disordered state of the Roman finances, was an absolute necessity.” He could
be abundantly “liberal to impoverished senators and knights, to cities and towns desolated
by natural calamity, and especially to men of letters and of the professor class,
several of whom he pensioned with salaries of as much as £800 a year.” He was a blunt,
plain soldier, without distinguished bearing, and perhaps for that very reason a greater
favorite with the army and the common people. “By his own example of simplicity of
life he put to shame the luxury and extravagance of the Roman nobles, and initiated in
many respects a marked improvement in the general tone of society,” while devoting
much thought to the spread and promotion of those intellectual tastes with which he
was not personally in sympathy.</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_55" id="Endnote_55"></a><a href="#ENanchor_55">[55]—page 523.</a> The tragic fate of Sabat is a matter of history, tho the story of the
dead bride is a legendary attachment. Josephus tells us that he “was one Jesus, the
son of Ananus, a plebeian and a husbandman, who four years before the war began,
and at a time when the city was in very great peace and prosperity, came to that feast
whereon it is our custom for every one to make tabernacles to God in the Temple, and
began on a sudden to cry aloud: ‘A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice
from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, a voice against the
bridegroom and the bride, and a voice against this whole people.’ This was his cry as
he went about by day and by night, in all the lanes of the city.” The efforts of the
people and even of the Roman procurator to suppress his cry were unavailing; and
when the scourge was applied, at every stroke of the whip his answer was: “Wo, wo
to Jerusalem!” “This cry was the loudest at the festivals; and he continued this
ditty for seven years and five months, without growing hoarse or being tired therewith,
until the very time that he saw his presage in earnest fulfilled in our siege, when it
ceased; for as he was going round on the wall, he cried out with his utmost force, ‘Wo,
wo to the city again, and to the people, and to the holy house!’ And just as he added at
the last, ‘Wo, wo to myself also!’ there came a stone out of one of the engines, and
smote him, and killed him immediately; and, as he was uttering the very same presage,
he gave up the ghost.”</p>

<p><a name="Endnote_56" id="Endnote_56"></a><a href="#ENanchor_56">[56]—page 531.</a> Josephus gives a somewhat detailed account of the final struggle and
of the burning of the Temple. After sharp conflict and setting fire to the doors and
outer courts of the Temple, Titus retired into the tower of Antonia, and “resolved to
storm the Temple the next day, early in the morning, with his whole army, and to encamp
round about the holy house.” The Jews, however, after a little, attacked the
Romans, who drove back those that were quenching the fire in the inner court of the
Temple, and those that guarded the holy house, and pursued them as far as the Holy
Place itself. The record is that at this time, on the tenth day of the month Ab, the day
on which it was formerly burned by the king of Babylon, “one of the soldiers, without
staying for any orders, and without any concern or dread upon him at so great an undertaking,
and being hurried on by a certain divine fury, snatched somewhat out of the
materials that were on fire, and being lifted up by another soldier, he set fire to a golden
window or lattice, through which there was a passage to the rooms that were round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
about the holy house, on the north side of it. As the flames went upward, the Jews
made a great clamor, such as so mighty an affliction required, and ran together to prevent
it; and now they spared not their lives any longer, nor suffered anything to restrain
their force, since that holy house was perishing, for whose sake it was that kept guard
about it.”</p>

<p>The utmost efforts of Titus to save the sacred building were utterly vain. “The
legionaries either could not or would not hear; they rushed on, trampling each other
down in their furious haste, or, stumbling over the crumbling ruins, perished with the
enemy. Each exhorted the other, and each hurled his blazing brand into the inner
part of the edifice, and then hurried to the work of carnage. The unarmed and defenseless
people were slain in thousands; they lay heaped, like sacrifices, round the
altar; the steps of the Temple ran with streams of blood, which washed down the
bodies which lay upon it.”</p>

<h3 id="JESUS">JESUS OF NAZARETH FROM THE PRESENT JEWISH POINT OF VIEW</h3>

<p>In this age and land, Jew and Christian seem destined at last
to give one another the glad hand. The old spirit of misunderstanding
and often of hate (which to our shame—more to the
shame of the Christian than of the Jew—has now lasted nearly
a score of centuries), in this light of noon, now and here, is intolerable.
At the dawn of the twentieth century, antisemitism in
America, even the feeblest whisper of it, is an anachorism, and
an anachronism of the grossest sort.</p>

<p>That spirit was natural enough with the church of the early
ages, for the church, nearly all of it, was simply the pagan tiger
baptized, and labels changed, but not the nature of the beast.
The Christ that was presented to the Jew the Jew did well to
hate, for he was a Christ of barbaric cruelty, a monster who
drove millions of Jews through fire and starvation, out of the
world, and this entire people for ages from their homes and countries.
If the Jews had not hated and spit on the very name of
that Christ, they had been more or less than human.</p>

<p>Among this people the ties of kinship are especially strong, so
that when a wrong is done to one, no other flame is needed to
make the blood of all boil. With the million of fires burning to
death their martyred brethren, quite naturally the air grew too
thick with smoke, and their eyes too sore with weeping, for them
to see any of the beauty of the Cross. Talk of the sweetness of
that Christ was hideous mockery to them. I too would join with
them and spit on such a Christ. But now the smoke is getting
out of the air, and the Jew, like the rest of us, is beginning to
see the real Jesus of the Gospels, and he also, like the rest of us
when we see Him aright, can not but respect, admire, love Him—claim
Him as one of his own people, saying, with Rabbi Henry
Berkowitz, of Philadelphia, this Jew, Jesus, “is the greatest,
noblest rabbi of them all,” and as the famous Jewish writer, Max
Nordau, touchingly says, “He is one of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, we are living in a better land and in a better time. Here
both Christian and Jew clasp the folds of the same flag and say,
Our Country, and both look up to the one God, the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, and say, Our Father; and may not both,
by and by, look to this Jew, Jesus of Nazareth, and say, Our
Brother?</p>

<p class="tb">Within the past two years I have written to a number of
representative Jews, residing in different parts of the world, asking
the question, <em>WHAT IS THE JEWISH THOUGHT TO-DAY
OF JESUS OF NAZARETH?</em> The inquiry was accompanied
with a copy of the letter from Dr. Kohler, which is here
published as the first of the series. There are utterances in some
of these published replies that may strike strangely and discordantly
on orthodox Christian hearts. It will be well for all
such to ponder the following letter, here given as prefatory to
the other replies. It is from the pen of Dr. Singer, a well-known
Jewish scholar, the originator and now the managing editor of
the Jewish Encyclopedia:</p>

<h4>A LETTER FROM ISIDORE SINGER, Ph.D.</h4>

<p>“It has been both a privilege and a pleasure to me to examine
in the original manuscript the letters which are printed on the
following pages. They are all from representative Jewish
scholars, theologians, historians, and philosophers, well and
most favorably known in the scientific world of Europe and

<p>“I regard Jesus of Nazareth as a Jew of the Jews, one whom
all Jewish people are learning to love. His teaching has been an
immense service to the world in bringing Israel’s God to the
knowledge of hundreds of millions of mankind.</p>

<p>“The great change in Jewish thought concerning Jesus of
Nazareth, I can not better illustrate than by this fact:</p>

<p>“When I was a boy, had my father, who was a very pious man,
heard the name of Jesus uttered from the pulpit of our synagog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
he and every other man in the congregation would have left the
building, and the rabbi would have been dismissed at once.</p>

<p>“Now, it is not strange, in many synagogs, to hear sermons
preached eulogistic of this Jesus, and nobody thinks of protesting,—in
fact, we are all glad to claim Jesus as one of our people.</p>

<h5>From KAUFMANN KOHLER Ph.D., Rabbi of Temple Beth-El, New
York:</h5>

<p>The true history of Jesus is so wrapped up in myth, the story of his
life told in the gospels so replete with contradictions, that it is rather
difficult for the unbiased reader to arrive at the true historical facts.
Still the beautiful tales about the things that happened around the lake
of Galilee show that there was a spiritual daybreak in that dark corner
of Judea of which official Judaism had failed to take sufficient cognizance.
“The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone”
of a new world.</p>

<p>It is assumed by entire Christendom that the Jews in rejecting Jesus
Christ brought upon themselves everlasting doom, the inexorable fate
of exile, persecution, and hatred. This view is based upon the crucifixion
story in the gospel records, which, while shielding the Romans,
maligns the Jews, and is incompatible with the simple facts of the Jewish
law, the older Christian tradition, with common sense, and with the
established character of Pontius Pilate, a very tiger in human shape.
Surely the records of the trial demand a revision.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Did the Jews Reject Christ?</span>” Most assuredly the weird and
visionary figure of the dead and rerisen Christ, the crucified Messiah
lifted up to the clouds there to become a partaker of God’s nature—a
metaphysical or mythological principle of the cosmos—the Jews did
reject. They would not, let it cost what it may, surrender the doctrine
of the unity and spirituality of God. Jesus, the living man, the teacher
and practiser of the tenderest love for God and man, the paragon of
piety, humility, and self-surrender, whose very failings were born of
overflowing goodness and sympathy with the afflicted, the Jews had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
cause to reject. He was one of the best and truest sons of the synagog.
Did he not say, “I have not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil
it”? What reason had the Jews for hating and persecuting him who
had nothing of the rigidity of the schoolman, none of the pride of the
philosopher and recluse, nor even the implacable zeal of the ancient
prophet to excite the popular wrath; who came only to weep with the
sorrowing, to lift up the downtrodden, to save and to heal? He was a
man of the people; why should the people have raised the cry, “Crucify
him!” against him whose only object in life was to bring home the
message of God’s love to the humblest of his children? Nor, in fact,
was he the only one among the popular preachers of the time who in
unsparing language and scathing satire exposed and castigated the abuses
of the ruling priesthood, the worldly Sadducees, as well as the hypocrisy
and false piety of some of the Pharisean doctors of the law. His
whole manner of teaching, the so-called Lord’s Prayer, the Golden Rule,
the code of ethics expounded for the elect ones in the Sermon on the
Mount, no less than his miraculous cures, show him to have been one of
the Essenes, a popular saint.</p>

<p>But he was more than an ordinary teacher and healer of men. He
went to the very core of religion and laid bare the depths of the human
soul. As a veritable prophet, Jesus, in such striking manner, disclaimed
allegiance to any of the Pharisean schools and asked for no authority
but that of the living voice within, while passing judgment on
the law, in order to raise life to a higher standard. He was a bold
religious and social reformer, eager to regenerate Judaism. True, a
large number of sayings were attributed to the dead master by his disciples
which had been current in the schools. Still, the charm of true
originality is felt in these utterances of his when the great realities of
life, when the idea of Sabbath, the principle of purity, the value of a
human soul, of woman, even of the abject sinner, are touched upon.
None can read these parables and verdicts of the Nazarene and not be
thrilled with the joy of a truth unspelled before. There is wonderful
music in the voice which stays an angry crowd, saying, “Let him that is
without sin cast the first stone!” that speaks the words, “Be like children,
and you are not far from the kingdom of God!”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Did the Jews Reject Christ?</span>” Jesus anticipated a reign of perfect
love, but centuries of hatred came. Could the Jews, victims of
Christian intolerance, look with calmness and admiration upon Jesus,
in whose name all the atrocities were perpetrated? Still, the leading
thinkers of Judaism willingly recognized that the founder of the Christian
Church, as well as that of Islamism, was sent by divine Providence
to prepare the pagan world for the Messianic kingdom of truth and
righteousness.</p>

<p>The Jew of to-day beholds in Jesus an inspiring ideal of matchless
beauty. While he lacks the element of stern justice expressed so forcibly
in the law and in the Old-Testament characters, the firmness of self-assertion
so necessary to the full development of manhood, all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
social qualities which build up the home and society, industry and
worldly progress, he is the unique exponent of the principle of redeeming
love. His name as helper of the poor, as sympathizing friend of the
fallen, as brother of every fellow sufferer, as lover of man and redeemer
of woman, has become the inspiration, the symbol, and the watchword
for the world’s greatest achievements in the field of benevolence. While
continuing the work of the synagog, the Christian Church with the
larger means at her disposal created those institutions of charity and
redeeming love that accomplished wondrous things. The very sign of
the cross has lent a new meaning, a holier pathos to suffering, sickness,
and sin, so as to offer new practical solutions for the great problems of
evil which fill the human heart with new joys of self-sacrificing love.</p>

<p>All this modern Judaism gladly acknowledges, reclaiming Jesus as
one of its greatest sons. But it denies that one single man, or one
church, however broad, holds the key to many-sided truth. It waits for
the time when all life’s deepest mysteries will have been spelled, and
to the ideals of sage and saint that of the seeker of all that is good,
beautiful, and true will have been joined; when Jew and Gentile, synagog
and church, will merge into the Church universal, into the great
city of humanity whose name is “God is there.”</p>

<h5>From MORITZ FRIEDLÄNDER, Ph.D., author of “Patristische und
Talmudische Studien,” “Das Judenthum in der vorchristlichen
griechischen Welt,” etc., Vienna, Austria:</h5>

<p>… The synagog of primitive Christianity was the direct offspring
of the Jewish synagog. Here, too, the center of sublime, divine service
which powerfully influenced the simple and pious souls, was Moses and
the prophets, hallowed, in addition, by the splendor of the invisibly
ruling Messiah.</p>

<p>In this synagog originated a new Israel, which silently and noiselessly
prospered beside “the burden of the law,” which killed the spirit
of the Mosaic doctrine and prepared the ossification and dwarfing of
Judaism.</p>

<p>This synagog was a true house of God, which made all those who
entered it enthusiastic for a pure Mosaism, whose principal doctrine was
the love of God and the love of man. Here every one, through teaching
and learning, invigorated himself, and even the most simple-minded
visitor left the house as an enthusiastic apostle. In short, it was a synagog
to which, if it existed to-day, all hearts would be drawn and
around which the entire enlightened Judaism of to-day would gather.
And Jesus himself, who was the starting-point of the synagog of the
Messianic community, who fertilized and rejuvenated it by the sublime
Messianic idea, was proclaimed as divine Redeemer because of
this rejuvenation, as well as because of the redemption undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
by him, on the Palestinian soil, from the “unsupportable burdens”
which the Pharisee teachers imposed on the people (Matt. xxiii. 4).</p>

<p>Always higher, on to unapproachableness grew his personality, including
all that is beautiful, lofty, sublime, and divine, and forcing
every one to adoration and self-nobilization. This divine “Son of
Man” became the world-ideal, and this sublime ideal has been originated
in Judaism, which will ever be remembered as having been predestined
by Providence to bring forth such a creation.</p>

<p><i>November 6, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From MORRIS JASTROW, Jr., Ph.D., Professor of Semitic Languages,
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa.:</h5>

<p>From the historic point of view, Jesus is to be regarded as a direct
successor of the Hebrew prophets. His teachings are synonymous with
the highest spiritual aspirations of the human race. Like the prophets,
he lays the chief stress upon pure conduct and moral ideas, but he goes
beyond the prophets in his absolute indifference to theological speculations
and religious rites. It is commonly said that the Jews rejected
Jesus. They did so in the sense in which they rejected the teachings of
their earlier prophets, but the question may be pertinently asked, Has
Christianity accepted Jesus? Neither our social nor our political system
rests upon the principles of love and charity, so prominently put forward
by Jesus.</p>

<p>The long hoped-for reconciliation between Judaism and Christianity
will come when once the teachings of Jesus shall have become the axioms
of human conduct.</p>

<p><i>November 6, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From BARON DAVID VON GÜNZBURG, St. Petersburg, Russia:</h5>

<p>Jesus of Nazareth sought to regenerate the common people of Galilee
by infusing into them the moral teaching of the academies; and to this
end he stripped the religious ideal of its scientific garb. Understood
perfectly by those who listened to him, his simple language, nevertheless,
proved a stumbling-block for those who had not known him, but
who desired, after his death, to commune with his apostles. They
construed current phrases as predicating actual entities, and having thus
created a certain type of Messiah, it therefore devolved upon succeeding
ages, under the influence of controversy and in the ardor of religious
polemics, to harmonize at once all the genuine traditions, all the ill-understood
and ill-reported addresses made by him, all his noble aspirations
which later generations failed to comprehend, and to bring them
all into accord with the ardent faith of new converts as well as with the
Bible texts relative to the Messiah.</p>

<h5>From PROF. DAVID CASTELLI, author of “Storia degli Israeliti,”
Florence, Italy:</h5>

<p>… Jesus in a certain sense fulfilled in his person the prophecies of
the Old Testament; they reached in him a height beyond which it is
impossible to go. He was not the magnificent worldly king, since there
could be no question of a worldly king in Israel again, for whom the
Hebrews waited in vain; but he was the great teacher of mankind,
spreading among all nations that principle of love and humanity which,
until then, had remained confined within the limits of Judaism. His
word, and after him that of the Apostles, who, like himself, were born
and reared in Judaism, were a powerful means of carrying into effect the
yet unfulfilled prophecy of the Old Testament: “The Lord will be King
of all the earth; in that day God will be one and his name one.”</p>

<p><i>September 28, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From MARCUS JASTROW, Ph.D., Rabbi Emeritus of Rodeph-Shalom
Congregation, Philadelphia, Pa., Author of the “Dictionary
of the Talmud,” etc.:</h5>

<p>The thoughtful Jews of all days, and especially of modern tendency
of thought, see in Jesus, as depicted in the New Testament, the exponent
of a part of the ethics of Judaism, and more especially of its milder
side—love and charity. The ethical sayings of Jesus reflect the conception
of Judaism in his own period, as it was current among its
spiritual leaders, such as Hillel, Rabbi Akiba, Ben Zoma, and others.
To a heathen world merged in vice and crime, to a civilization that led
the thoughtful among Romans and Greeks toward the abyss of pessimism
and despair, Christianity offered the bright prospect of forgiveness and
reconciliation with goodness. For the Jews it had no mission, no new
gifts to offer. Its ethics appear to the modern Jew one-sided and exaggerated;
the sense of justice appears to be pushed into the background
in favor of an unrealizable ideal of love.</p>

<p>Judaism prohibits revenge and the bearing of grudge, commands the
assistance of an enemy in distress, but “to love one’s enemy” appears to
the modern Jew a somewhat morbid philanthropy that could never have
been seriously meant. To bear indignities with patience, “to be of the
insulted and not of the insulters,” is a Jewish principle, but to offer the
right cheek to him who slaps you on the left, to offer the undergarment
to him who takes away your cloak—no, we will not and we can not do
it. Hence it is that we Jews, of our modern days, speak of Jesus with
that respect which all high-minded dreamers of all ages and nations
inspire, even though we can not accept all their ideas and ideals, and
are mindful of the fact that it is to noble dreamers that humanity is indebted
for its most precious possessions.</p>

<h5>From ÉMILE LÉVY, Chief Rabbi, Bayonne, France:</h5>

<p>Wide as the difference may be in certain essential points between
Christianity and Judaism, yet the former approaches the latter through
its origin, and a common basis which is love of God and man. In
proclaiming the superiority of spirit over matter, and the principle of
immortality of the soul and of a future life; in exhorting mankind in
a touching and poetical language, ever trying to come nearer the divine
example by a charitable, humble, modest, and pure life, Christ has
rendered immense services to humanity and to the cause of progress and
civilization, for he thus spread the Jewish doctrine, which aims at a continual
improvement of the individual and of society, and contributes to
the preparation of the Messianic era and of the brotherhood of the nations.</p>

<p><i>October 24, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From HENRY BERKOWITZ, D.D., Rabbi of Rodeph Shalom Congregation,
Founder and Chancellor of the Jewish Chautauqua
Society, Philadelphia, Pa.:</h5>

<p>… To me one of the saddest and most tragic facts in history is this,
that Jesus, the gentlest and noblest rabbi of them all, should have become
lost to his own people by reason of the conduct of those who called
themselves his followers. In Jesus there is the very flowering of Judaism.
What pathos, then, in the fact that his own people have been made
to shun his very name; that even to-day they speak it with bated breath,
because it has been made to them a symbol and a synonym of all that is
unjewish, unchristian—irreligious.…</p>

<h5>From JOSEPH REINACH, Paris, France, formerly Member of the
Chamber of Deputies, and editor-in-chief of <cite lang="fr">La République
Française</cite>; Secretary to Gambetta, and editor of Gambetta’s
works:</h5>

<p>… The characteristic mark of Jesus’s moral is love, the purest and
noblest love that ever existed—love for all human creatures, love for
the poor, love for the wicked. Love is joy, and love is duty, and love
is life. Humanity, since its first day and to its last day, was and will
be thirsty for love, and Jesus is and will remain one of the highest, if
not the highest, type of humanity, because his words, and his legend,
and his poetry are and will be an eternal source of love.</p>

<p><i>November 28, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From CESARE LOMBROSO, Professor of Psychiatry and Criminology,
University of Turin, Italy:</h5>

<p>In my eyes Jesus is one of the greatest geniuses the world has produced,
but he was, like all geniuses, somewhat unbalanced, anticipating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
by ten centuries the emancipation of the slave, and by twenty centuries
socialism and the emancipation of woman. He did not proceed by a
precise, systematic demonstration, but through short sentences and by
leaps and bounds, so that without the downfall of the Temple, and without
the persecutions of the Christians under Nero, his work would have
been lost.…</p>

<p><i>September 29, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From MAX NORDAU, M.D., critic and philosopher, Paris, France:</h5>

<p>… Jesus is soul of our soul, as he is flesh of our flesh. Who, then,
could think of excluding him from the people of Israel? St. Peter will
remain the only Jew who said of the son of David, “I know not the man.”
If the Jews up to the present time have not publicly rendered homage to
the sublime moral beauty of the figure of Jesus, it is because their tormentors
have always persecuted, tortured, assassinated them in his name.
The Jews have drawn their conclusions from the disciples as to the
master, which was a wrong, a wrong pardonable in the eternal victims
of the implacable, cruel hatred of those who called themselves Christians.
Every time that a Jew mounted to the sources and contemplated Christ
alone, without his pretended faithful, he cried, with tenderness and admiration:
“Putting aside the Messianic mission, this man is ours. He
honors our race and we claim him as we claim the Gospels—flowers of
Jewish literature and only Jewish.…”</p>

<h5>From ISIDORE HARRIS, M.A., Rabbi of West London Synagog of
British Jews, London, England:</h5>

<p>It seems to me that the truest view of Jesus is that which regards him
as a Jewish reformer of a singularly bold type. In his days, Judaism
had come to be overlaid with formalism. The mass of rabbinical laws
that in the course of centuries had grown round the Torah of Israel
threatened to crush out its spirit. Jesus protested against this tendency
with all the energy of an enthusiast. Ceremonial can never be anything
more than a means to an end—that end being the realization of the
higher life of communion with God. The rabbinical doctors of the
law were inclined to treat it as an end in itself, and this Jesus saw
was a mistake. In taking up this position, he was simply following in
the path that had already been marked out centuries before by the Hebrew
prophets.</p>

<p><i>October 17, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From JECHESKIEL CARO, Ph.D., Chief Rabbi, Lemberg, Austria:</h5>

<p>Primitive Christianity, as Jesus of Nazareth taught and preached it,
is not at all different from the ethical principles of Judaism. He himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
proclaimed that he did not come to destroy the law. In morality
and the love of God and man (Deut. vi. 5; Matt. xxii. 37; Lev. xvii. 18;
Matt. xxii. 39) are contained the real essence and the categorical imperative
of religion.…</p>

<p><i>October 18, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From N. PORGES, Ph.D., Rabbi, Leipsic, Germany:</h5>

<p>Even the most conscientious Jew may, without hesitation, recognize
that in view of the immense effect and success of his life, Jesus has become
a figure of the highest order in the history of religion, and that
the noble man, the pure character, the mild heart-winning personality,
come forth unmistakable even from the mythical cover which surrounds
his person. The fact that Jesus was a Jew should, I think, in
our eyes, rather help than hinder the acknowledgment of his high significance,
and it is completely incomprehensible to me why a Jew should
think and speak about Jesus otherwise than with the highest respect,
although we, as Jews, repudiate the belief in his Messianic character
and his divine humanity with the utmost energy, from innate conviction.</p>

<p><i>September 28, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From the late JAMES H. HOFFMAN, Founder and first President of
the Hebrew Technical Institute, New York City:</h5>

<p>… I revere him (Jesus) for having brought home by his own life and
his teachings, to the innermost hearts and souls of mankind, of all times,
in every station, the eternal truths as first embodied in the Mosaic code
and proclaimed in undying words by the prophets. I recognize in him
the blending of the divine and human, the lofty and lowly, showing the
path for the dual nature of man, by divine aspirations to gain the victory
over the earthly life, tending to draw him downward—the Son of
God triumphing over the child of the earth.…</p>

<p><i>October 6, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From ADOLF BRUELL, Ph.D., Editor “<cite lang="de">Populär-Wissenschaftliche
Monatsblütter</cite>,” Frankfort-on-the-Main, Germany:</h5>

<p>… In Christianity, as it is represented in the Gospels, the sublime
doctrines of Judaism, if we subtract the dogmas, find their most beautiful
expression. If we deduct the purely human additions, as well in
Judaism where they take the form of observances, as in Christianity,
where they crystallize themselves into dogmas, we find that there is no
real antagonism between the two. And how could it be otherwise, for
did not Jesus stand upon the ground of biblical and prophetical Judaism?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The fact that love, the highest religious principle, has not yet fully penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
Christianity, as is shown by the awful fanaticism of the Middle
Ages and the odious anti-Jewish movement of our own time, does not
alter the fact that Jesus promulgated a sublime doctrine which is in full
harmony with Judaism, and with which Christianity must be entirely
imbued before it can be seriously called the religion of Christ.…</p>

<p>Judaism and Christianity both have still to go through a process of
purification as to law and dogma, and only after these separating walls
have fallen, will Jews and Christians, and with them all humanity,
on the terrain of pure morality and the spirit of the prophets, tender
one another forever the hand of brotherhood in the noble spirit of reconciliation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it would be appropriate that honest and enthusiastic men
might form an alliance in order to reconcile Judaism and Christianity,
and for this purpose Jesus and the prophets would be rather genial helpers
than detractors.</p>

<p><i>October 10, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From THÉODORE REINACH, Ph.D., former President of the Société
des Etudes Juives, Paris, France:</h5>

<p>Although we know very little with certainty concerning the life and
teachings of Christ, we know enough of him to believe that, in morals
as well as in theology, he was the heir and continuator of the old prophets
of Israel. There is no necessary gap between Isaiah and Jesus, but it
is the misfortune of both Christianity and Judaism that a gap has been
effected by the infiltration of heathen ideas in the one, and the stubborn
(only too explainable) reluctance of the other, to admit among its prophets
one of its greatest sons. I consider it the duty of both enlightened
Christians and Jews to endeavor to bridge over this gap.</p>

<p><i>December 17, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From JACOB H. SCHIFF, New York City:</h5>

<p>We Jews honor and revere Jesus of Nazareth as we do our own prophets
who preceded him. By his martyrdom, his teachings have been emphasized,
and these are to this day I believe often better practised by
the descendants of the race he sprang from than by those who have
become the followers of Christ in name, but not in spirit, else the prejudice
practised by the latter against Jews would not exist.…</p>

<h5>From SIMON WOLF, LL.D., former Consul of the United States to
Egypt, Vice-President of Order B’ne B’rith, Washington, D. C.:</h5>

<p>I have not had the time nor the desire to investigate the alleged divinity
of the Christian Savior. I have, however, recognized the great influence
his character and labors have exercised throughout the world.
If properly understood and if properly construed, I have no doubt whatsoever
that what he aimed at and labored for would prove of great benefit
to every human being. I look upon him, in short, as a great teacher
and reformer, one who aimed at the uplifting of suffering humanity,
whose every motive was kindness, mercy, charity, and justice, and if
his wise teaching and example have not always been followed, the blame
should not be his, but rather those who have claimed to be his followers.
I have the very highest regard for him as a man who reflects in his sayings
the divine Spirit, which after all is nothing more or less than a
reflex of the Jewish ethics in which he was so well grounded.</p>

<h5>From H. WEINSTOCK, Sacramento, Cal. Extract from a letter to
Dr. K. Kohler:</h5>

<div class="smaller">

<p>[The letter urges reasons why the life and sayings of Jesus should be taught in Jewish
Sabbath-schools. Dr. Kohler approves of the suggestion.]</p>

</div>

<p>With the growing enlightenment and the broadening atmosphere
under which the modern Jew lives, the progressive Jew looks upon the
Nazarene as one of Israel’s great teachers, who has a potent influence
on civilization, whose words and deeds have left an undying imprint
upon the human mind, and have done heroic work toward universalizing
the God of Israel and the Bible. This change of sentiment toward Jesus
is largely due to the intelligent and progressive preaching of our modern
rabbis, who seem to appreciate the glory Jesus has shed upon the Jewish
name, and the splendid work he did in broadening the influence of the
Jewish teachings. But, despite all this, the fact remains, that, so far
as I know, not one Jewish Sabbath-school in the land teaches a single
word concerning Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>To maintain a continued silence in the Jewish Sabbath-school on
Jesus would seem a grave error.…</p>

<p>The influence of “Jesus the Christ” may be diminishing in the rational
world, but the influence of “Jesus the Man” is increasing daily
the world over, and no Jewish education can be complete that does not
embody within it a comprehensive knowledge of Jesus the Jew, his life,
his teachings, and the causes which led to his death.…</p>

<p>It would seem to be in the highest interest of the modern Jew and
Judaism that the curriculum of at least every reform Jewish Sabbath-school
should, from a purely historical standpoint, embrace a simple
yet comprehensible history of the life of Jesus, and its wonderful moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
and religious influence, in order that the rising Jews may be able to
appreciate better the powerful influence Judaic teachings and the Bible
have had upon civilization, and the exalted place given by the world
to one of their teachers and brethren, who lived a purely Jewish life
and taught only Jewish precepts.…</p>

<p><i>September 26, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From GUSTAV GOTTHEIL, Ph.D., Rabbi Emeritus of Temple
Emanu-El, New York:</h5>

<p>The keynote of prophetic religion of the Jewish prophets was holiness
of life and purity of heart. Love and mercy shown by men, one
to another, make up the acceptable worship of the Holy One of Israel.
To place the Master of Nazareth by their side can surely be no dishonor
to him, nor can it dim the luster of his name. If he has added to their
spiritual bequests new jewels of religious truth, and spoken words
which are words of life, because they touch the deepest springs of the
human heart, why should we Jews not glory in him? Show us the man,
help us to understand his mind, draw from his face the thick veil behind
which his personality has been buried for the Jewish life by the
heartless zeal of his so-called followers, and you will find the Jewish
heart as responsive to truth and light and love as that of all other nations.
The question whether Jesus suffered martyrdom solely for his
new teachings or for other causes, we will not discuss. The crown of
thorns on his head makes him only the more our brother. For to this
day it is borne by his people. Were he alive to-day, who, think you,
would be nearer his heart—the persecuted or the persecutors?</p>

<p><i>October 24, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From EMANUEL WEILL, Rabbi of the Portuguese Congregation,
Paris, France:</h5>

<p>I do not know the secret of God, but I believe that Jesus and Christianity
were providential means, useful to the Deity in guiding all men
gradually, and by an effort, keeping pace with the mental state of the
majority of men from paganism up to the pure and true idea of the
divinity.</p>

<p>The error—one might almost say a fatal one—of Christianity is to
believe that it is an end in itself, whereas it is but a step, and as error
often generates evil, Christianity in its evolution toward its end has
effected side by side much good as well as much harm.</p>

<p>We Jews await the Christians on God’s appointed day, when, all humanity
having become more enlightened, will rally to the spiritualistic
principle which is that of Judaism, viz.: that of the unity and the perfect
spirituality of God, in opposition to any incarnation and to any
trinitarian idea whatever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I think that Jews and Christians, divided on the identification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
of Jesus with God, but both in accord in acknowledging this
God the same for all, consider themselves children of the same Father,
and thus love one another with brotherly love.</p>

<p><i>October 11, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From M. KAYSERLING, Ph.D., Rabbi, Budapest, Hungary:</h5>

<p>The Jews rejected Jesus as the Messiah and Redeemer, but they recognized
him as “the extraordinary man” who first showed to the heathen
world the way to natural religion and moral perfection. “The founder
of Christianity,” says the pious and scholarly Jacob Emden of Altona,
who lived about the middle of the last century, “was a twofold benefactor
to the world, since, on the one hand, he strengthened with all his
might the doctrine of Moses and insisted upon its eternal validity; and,
on the other hand, drew heathens away from idolatry and obligated
them to observe the seven Noachian commandments to which he added
moral teachings. The alliance of the nations in our time can be regarded
as an alliance to the glory of God, whose aim is to proclaim over
all the world that there is only one God who is Master in heaven and on
earth; who rewards the good and punishes the evil.”</p>

<p>This is the opinion of the immense majority of the Jews of our epoch
about Jesus of Nazareth, “the extraordinary man.” We all look forward
to that sublime end when all human beings, prompted by the love
of fellow men, shall recognize God and worship Him in full harmony
and glory as the one only God.</p>

<p><i>November 20, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From DAVID PHILIPSON, D.D., Professor in Hebrew Union College,
Rabbi of Mound Street Temple, Cincinnati, Ohio:</h5>

<p>There is no backwardness nor hesitancy on the part of modern Jewish
thought in acknowledging the greatness of the teacher of Nazareth, the
sweetness of his character, the power of his genius. But, as a matter
of course, we accord him no exceptional position as the flower of humanity,
the special incarnation of the Divinity. Judaism holds that
every man is the son of God. Jesus was a Jew of the Jews. The orthodox
Christianity of to-day he would scarcely recognize, as its chief
dogmas were unknown to him.</p>

<p><i>September 19, 1899.</i></p>

<h5>From EMIL G. HIRSCH, Ph.D., LL.D., L.H.D., Rabbi of Sinai Congregation,
Professor of Rabbinical Literature in Chicago University,
Chicago, Ill.:</h5>

<p>… For me Jesus is an historical reality. To understand his
work and correctly to value his mission, one must bear in mind his own
time. Galilean as he was, he must have grown up under influences
making for an intense Jewish patriotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span></p>

<p>… Under close analysis, his precepts will be found to contain nothing
that was new. There is scarce an expression credited to him but
has its analogon in the well-known sayings of the rabbis. He did not
pretend to found a new religion. The doctrines he developed were the
familiar truths of Israel’s prophetic monotheism. Nor did his ethical
proclamation sound a note before unknown in the household of the synagogue
or in the schools. He was in method a wonderfully gifted Haggadist.
His originality lies in the striking form which he understood
to give to the old vitalities of his ancestral religion. He moved the
heart of the people.</p>

<p>… The Jews of every shade of religious belief do not regard Jesus
in the light of Paul’s theology. But the gospel Jesus, the Jesus who
teaches so superbly the principles of Jewish ethics, is revered by all
the liberal expounders of Judaism. His words are studied; the New
Testament forms a part of Jewish literature. Among the great preceptors
that have worded the truths of which Judaism is the historical
guardian, none, in our estimation and esteem, takes precedence of the
rabbi of Nazareth. To impute to us suspicious sentiments concerning
him does us gross injustice. We know him to be among our greatest
and purest.</p>

<p><i>January 26, 1901.</i></p>

<h4>MEMORANDUM JOTTINGS</h4>

<p>Here are some of the jottings which I find on my memorandum
pad, suggested by the reading of these Jewish letters—letters
which it would be difficult to read without feeling that at last Jew
and Christian, after a horrible nightmare of misunderstandings
centuries long, are coming to see that after all they are first
cousins, if not actually brothers.</p>

<p>1. Right nobly is it in some of these Jewish writers to say that
Jesus is not to be blamed for those awful persecutions committed
for ages in His name, and in reverse of His teachings. As
He foretold, many were called by His name whom He knew not,
and who knew not Him—false prophets who came in sheep’s
clothing, but were, within, ravening wolves. Sometimes these
wolves tore the Jews, sometimes they tore one another, and sometimes
they tore the real Christians. But we live, all of us, in a
better time. The glowing sky is not sunset, but is sunrise—sunrise
of a glorious day that is to reveal a far wider brotherhood
than the world ever heretofore has known.</p>

<p>2. Jewish friends, “Let the dead past bury its dead.” All the
world is bound to realize sooner or later that your history has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
been of inestimable advantage to the world. Turn your faces to
that rapidly advancing future. The divine reason will appear
for all the sorrows of the past ages, for all the persecutions, misapprehensions,
including the errors into which you and we have
fallen—largely <em>because</em> of these, not in spite of them, the Jewish
race will arise a purified flame.</p>

<p>Look the future in the face. As Shelley has put it: “The past
is dead, and the future alone is living.” Why not, all of us, permit
the ashes to grow over the embers of hate, and let the rawness
of all wounds, real or imaginary, heal over? Distance now
gives a wider survey and a juster survey to both Jew and
Christian.</p>

<p>Waste no time in denying hostility to Jesus nineteen hundred
years ago. Who alive to-day is to be blamed for that any
more than for the forty years of rebellion in the wilderness? No
more are you to be blamed for the death of Jesus than are we to-day
to be blamed for Washington having held slaves, and for the
slave auction-block in the Nation’s capital, and for the slave lash
a generation ago.</p>

<p>3. The Mosaic system of ceremonies, as seen before the destruction
of Jerusalem, was beautiful. How mournfully are Jewish
eyes still fixed upon the broken shell. Friends, lift your eyes
and see what came out of that shell; see in the boughs above, the
singing-bird of the civilization of to-day. Claim it all, for God
has given it to the world through your people.</p>

<p>From the matrix of the Jewish soul sprang Christianity.
Heine, the great Jewish writer of the last century, has wittily put
it: Half the civilized world worships a Jew, the other half a Jewess.</p>

<p>4. Come, children of the prophets, your home, for a season at
least, is in the West, not in the East. Let not your hearts longer
be troubled. Cease dragging about with you that monstrous
corpse of memory—the persecutions committed against you, no
matter how frightfully you have been misunderstood and
wronged.</p>

<p>Above all let it never be truly said that the Jew has suffered so
much, and come so far, now only to reap despair and bitterness.
There are two Jewish tendencies to-day, one to cold materialism,
the motto of which is “make money, eat, drink, be merry, to-morrow
ye die”; the other is upward, the path the prophets walked.
This latter tendency must be made to dominate. The time will
come, with many already here, when the Jew will turn again
to his sublime mission and say, like Agassiz, “I have not time
to make money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely, the Jew of America is to be a regenerating educational
force to the Jews of all the world, and not to the Jews only. It
does not yet appear fully what he shall be; but in some way it
will appear that this mass of concentrated human energy will
arise above the commercial, the material, the sordid, which so
dominates much of the so-called Christian world. The Jewish
genius is essentially religious. The Jew will again come to himself
and find his center, and God will vindicate His purpose
through this wonderful people from Abraham’s time to the
present.</p>

<p>The Jew has grown strong by the law of the survival of the fittest.
For eighteen centuries he has not known what security is,
always living by his resource of keenest wit—the feeblest dying
out. Those who were physically strong enough and mentally
clever enough, escaped destruction, and these became the parents
of the new and stronger generation. Thus the law of compensation
works justice. For ages the Jew was compelled to be a
money-lender as the business of such an one was held to be disreputable
for Christians. Thus the Jew mastered the problems of
finance, and now when finance rules the world, the Jew is naturally
on the throne. The whirligig of time is twirled by a hand
that cares for justice.</p>

<p>5. How unseemly, impossible, that it should prove in the end
that they who have been to the world messengers of God, whose
feet have been beautiful upon the mountain-tops and who did eat
the bread of angels, should now forget their prophets and their
God and grovel in materialism, and seek to satisfy their hunger
with husks. No; this can not be. This people have done too
glorious things for humanity, for such an ending. They have in
them the nobility that will assert itself. They are born for great
things yet to be; they have been made in large molds. They,
like the best of us, have often slipped, but are now coming to
themselves. For one I am glad, and thank God for it.</p>

<p>Now will the Christian Church permit a friendly exhortation:
You have tried everything to get the Jewish people to understand
Jesus of Nazareth, except one thing, <em>love</em>. Try that, for they
believe in love; and you believe in love. Let both Jew and
Christian get on this common ground, and have respect for the
honest convictions of one another, and then both may clasp
hands and look into each other’s eyes, and repeat the words uttered
alike by Moses and by Jesus:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Lord our God is one God. And thou shalt love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy might.</span>”</p>

<p>The lightnings from Mount Sinai and the rays of light and
heat from Mount Calvary are one, and will yet fuse into brotherhood
all peoples of the earth.</p>

<h4>WILLIAM McKINLEY.</h4>

<p class="center">[A Letter. Washington, D.C., 1900.]</p>

<p>The religion which Christ founded has been a mighty influence in the
civilization of the human race. If we of to-day owed to it nothing
more than this, our debt of appreciation would be incalculable. The
doctrine of love, purity, and right-living has step by step won its way
into the heart of mankind, has exalted home and family, and has filled
the future with hope and promise.</p>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Complete Works.</span> (Emilius.) Edinburgh: 1778, vol. ii., pp. 215-218.]</p>

<p>I will confess to you that the majesty of the Scriptures strikes me
with admiration, as the purity of the Gospel has its influence on my
heart. Peruse the works of our philosophers, with all their pomp of
diction; how mean, how contemptible are they, compared with the
Scriptures! Is it possible that the sacred personage whose history they
contain should be Himself a mere man?… Where is the man, where
the philosopher, who could so live and die, without weakness, and without
ostentation? When Plato describes his imaginary righteous man,
loaded with all the punishments of guilt, yet meriting the highest rewards
of virtue, he describes exactly the character of Jesus Christ.
The resemblance is so striking that all the Church fathers perceived it.</p>

<p>Through the fair gloss of His manhood, we perceive the rich bloom
of His divinity. If He is not now without an assailant, at least He is
without a rival. If He be not the Sun of Righteousness, the Friend

<p>If I am asked whether it is in my nature to pay Him devout reverence,
I say, certainly. I bow before Him as the divine manifestation
of the highest principles of morality.… Let mental culture go on advancing,
let the natural sciences go on gaining in depth and breadth,
and the human mind expand as it may, it will never go beyond the elevation
and moral culture of Christianity, as it glistens and shines forth
in the Gospel.…</p>

<p>Jesus Christ belonged to the true race of prophets. He saw with open
eye the mystery of the soul. Drawn by its severe harmony, ravished
with its beauty, He lived in it, and had His being there. Alone in all
history, He estimated the greatness of man. One man was true to what
is in you and me. He saw that God incarnated Himself in man, and
evermore goes forth anew to take possession of His world.…</p>

<p>The supernatural being and power of Jesus may be disputed; but the
perfection, the sublimity of His acts and precepts, of His life and His
moral law, are incontestable. And in effect, not only are they not contested,
but they are admired and celebrated enthusiastically, and complacently
too; it would seem as if it were desired to restore to Jesus
as man, and man alone, the superiority of which men deprived Him in
refusing to see in Him the Godhead.</p>

this man as the ideal representative and guide of humanity; nor even

<p>It may be truly said that the simple record of three short years of
active life has done more to regenerate and soften mankind than all the
disquisitions of philosophers and all the exhortations of moralists.
This has, indeed, been the wellspring of whatever is best and purest
in the Christian life. Amid all the sins and failings, amid all the

an enduring principle of regeneration.</p>

<p>He founded the pure worship—of no age, of no clime—which shall
be that of all lofty souls to the end of time. Not only was His religion
that day (John iv. 24) the benign religion of humanity, but it was the
absolute religion; and if other planets have inhabitants endowed with
reason and morality, their religion can not be different from that which
Jesus proclaimed at Jacob’s well.…</p>

<p>Whatever may be the surprises of the future, Jesus will never be surpassed.

call forth tears without end; His sufferings will melt the noblest hearts;
all ages will proclaim that among the sons of men there is none born
greater than Jesus.</p>

<h3 id="THE_SECOND_COMING">THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST—A SUCCINCT HISTORY</h3>

<p class="by">BY DANIEL SEELYE GREGORY. D.D., LL.D.</p>

<p>The legend of “The Wandering Jew,” in its various forms, has its
basis in the doctrine of the Second Coming of Christ, or of His personal
return to this world. This is true of the form of the legend that underlies
Croly’s romance, the Lord Himself having given assurance of His
return to the hero of the work and the arch-plotter, in the words of
doom: “Tarry thou till I come!” The doctrine of the Second Coming
has been accepted by the Christian Church and embodied in its creeds
in all ages.</p>

<p>The Second Advent finds its analog in many respects in the First
Advent, and that, not in its facts only, but in its difficulties as well.
According to the Old Testament, a great Redeemer was to appear; he
was to be a prophet, priest, and king, and was to deliver his people from
their sins and from their oppressors; he was to set up a kingdom that
should become universal, absorbing all earthly kingdoms; and he was
to exalt his people to the summit of prosperity and glory. These predictions
turned the minds of the whole Jewish race toward the future,
in confident expectation of the coming Messiah, in whose birth and
career they all anticipated their fulfilment. Nevertheless, tho Christ
came indeed fulfilling prophecy, it was “in a way which no man did anticipate
or could have anticipated.”</p>

<p>So the main features of the Second Advent have been prophetically
presented with like fulness, and yet, as of old, the Church has had to
remain “satisfied with the great truths which those prophecies unfold,
and leave the details to be explained by the event.”</p>

<p>The many theories of the Second Coming of Christ and of the millennium—or
the thousand years’ reign of Christ at the end of time, as
connecting with that coming—may be reduced to two, one based upon
the literal and the other upon the spiritual interpretation of the Scriptures
on this subject.</p>

<p>1st. The <em>literal</em>, or <em>Chiliastic</em>, notion of the millennium, as held by
some Christians, was derived from the Jews, and was largely confined
originally to the converts from Judaism to Christianity. The Jewish
doctrine received its peculiar form from Rabbi Elias, who lived about
two centuries before the Christian era. According to this ante-Jewish
tradition:</p>

<p>“The world is to last seven thousand years—six thousand to be years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
of toil and trouble, and the seventh thousand to be a grand <span class="smcap">Sabbatism</span>.
It is to be ushered in by the advent of the Messiah, who is to establish
his throne at Jerusalem. The Holy City is to be rebuilt with surpassing
magnificence, as described by Tobit (xiii., xiv.); the Jews are to
return to Palestine; their pious ancestors are to be raised from the dead
and reign in their own land, with their offspring, under the Messiah”
(see T. O. Summers, in Johnson’s “Universal Cyclopedia,” article “Millennium”).</p>

<p class="tb">Some of the early Christians—like the early Jews, pressed with persecutions
and longing for temporal deliverance—adopted this literal view,
except that they modified it by recognizing Jesus as the true Messiah,
and by acknowledging the equality of Gentile with Jewish believers in
the millennial age. The Thessalonian Christians, in particular, early
developed a tendency to the literal, Chiliastic interpretation, which was,
however, checked and corrected by Paul’s letters to them.</p>

<p>But the first teacher who is clearly recorded as having adopted the
crude Jewish notion was Papias, Bishop of Hierapolis, in Phrygia;
altho Cerinthus, a heretic of the first century, is said to have held it.
According to Irenæus, Papias pretended to have received a glowing
tradition direct from the Apostle John embodying and enlarging all the
Jewish literalism.</p>

<p>In part it is to this effect: “The days shall come in which there
shall be vines which shall severally have ten thousand branches, and
every one of these shall have ten thousand lesser branches, and every
one of these branches shall have ten thousand twigs, and every one of
these twigs shall have ten thousand clusters of grapes, and in every one
of these clusters shall be ten thousand grapes, and every one of these
grapes being pressed shall give twenty-five <i lang="la">metretas</i> of wine; and when
a person shall take hold of one of these sacred bunches, another shall
cry out, ‘I am a better bunch, take me, and by me bless the Lord.’”</p>

<p>Irenæus reports similar fanciful traditions respecting extraordinary
temporal blessings during the millennial period. Papias taught that
Christ’s reign on earth should be corporeal. In the main, Justin Martyr,
Irenæus, Tertullian, Nepos, and Lactantius agree with Papias,
teaching the Christians under their instruction these views, each varying
the details according to his own fancy.</p>

<p>The disciples of Papias and their successors naturally pressed into
their service Rev. xx. 1-10, interpreting it with the baldest literalness.</p>

<p>The same method has been used by the later followers, who have
largely held to a literal, corporeal reign of Christ on earth for a thousand
years. There has often been coupled with this view—growing out of
Christ’s teaching of the <span class="smcap">Imminency</span> of his Second Coming—a belief in
the <span class="smcap">Immediacy</span> of that Coming.</p>

<p>2d. The usual or <em>Catholic</em> theory of the millennium has its basis in
the spiritual, rather than literal, interpretation of the Scriptures on this
subject. It rejects alike Jewish traditions and Patristic fancies.</p>

<p>According to this view, the number 1,000 is often employed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
Scriptures as “denoting a definite number for an indefinite.” It is so
used manifestly in Psalm xc. 4, in 2 Peter iii. 8, and in Rev. xx. 1-7.
In the last passage, as has been often remarked, it is “evidently a definite
number for an indefinite,” indicating a long period. The entire
passage is figurative, in keeping with the enigmatical book in which it
is found. The angel with the key of the abyss, a chain and a seal to
bind and confine the devil, thrones and the souls of martyrs seated upon
them, and judgment given to them—these are all “pictorial representations
of the circumscription of Satan’s power, the revival of the martyr
spirit in the Church, and the general prevalence of truth and righteousness
in the earth. This agrees with the figurative style of the Apocalypse,
and corresponds with the predictions concerning the prosperity
of the Church in the last days. In no other place is there any allusion
to a millennium.”</p>

<p>This interpretation, it is held, is agreeable to the style of prophecy,
that is elsewhere employed in the Revelation (compare Isa. xxvi.
19; Ezek. xxxvii. 13, 14; Hos. vi. 2; Rev. xi. 7, 11). This spiritual
view also agrees with the paracletal work of Christ, while the Judaico-Christian
does not; it is favorable to the efforts of the Church for the
conversion of the world, and accords with the general teachings of the
Scriptures concerning “the last things.”</p>

<p>But while the literal method has been to some extent followed, there
has been a common or <em>Catholic</em> Church-doctrine which, as will be seen,
has alone been embodied in the creeds of Christendom. That <em>common</em>,
<em>creedal</em>, or <em>Catholic doctrine</em> embraces the teachings that—</p>

<p>1st. The Second Advent of Jesus is to be a personal, visible, and
glorious advent as the Son of God.</p>

<p>2d. It is to be preceded by the universal diffusion of the Gospel, the
conversion of the Jews and the coming of Antichrist.</p>

<p>3d. It is to be accompanied by the resurrection of the dead, just and
unjust, the general judgment, the end of the world, and the consummation
of Christ’s kingdom.</p>

<p>The cardinal passages of Scripture on this doctrine are <cite>Matthew xxiv.</cite>
and <cite>the two Epistles to the Thessalonians</cite>—the latter of which was apparently
rendered necessary by the development of the teachings in the
former. It is not possible to enter here into a detailed interpretation
of these passages. Had there been no extraneous influences at work,
what is claimed to be the simple and natural interpretation of these
Scriptures, which has always been in accord with the Catholic doctrine
embodied in the creeds, would probably have continued to be the faith
of all Christians.</p>

<p>The later-Jewish doctrine of the Messianic kingdom upon earth was
a main influence in directing the new development. The disciples being
Jews were naturally infected with this view, and did not rise above it
till after the experiences of Pentecost.</p>

<p>Millenarianism or Chiliasm naturally arose out of sympathy with
this Jewish materialism, and spread to some extent among the Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
Christians in the early Church. There was also introduced the doctrine
of <em>two resurrections</em>, based on the literal understanding of Rev. xx., unmodified
by the teachings of Jesus in Matt, xxiv. With the Second
Advent of Christ, according to this view, is to take place the first resurrection,
that of the righteous dead at that time. Then is to follow a
personal, corporeal reign of Christ for a thousand years—a millennium—upon
the renovated earth. At the close of this millennial period, the
second resurrection, that of the righteous and the wicked, is to occur,
and the end of the world.</p>

<p>As already hinted, this doctrine at first started and became prevalent
among the Jewish, as distinguished from the Gentile, Christians. Persecutions
arising from time to time, and the distressed conditions resulting
from governmental opposition have, however, extended to the
Gentile Christians belief in the corporeal features of Chiliasm. They
have likewise resulted at various times in an earnest longing for the
<em>immediate</em> return of Christ, in an expectation of His <em>immediate setting
up of His kingdom</em> in the place of the earthly kingdoms, and in belief in
the <em>imminence of His advent</em>.</p>

<p>The conflict between the earlier and Catholic doctrine and this Chiliastic
outgrowth may readily be traced in the history of the Church. It
appeared in its full development, first of all, early in the apostolic age,
in connection with the Church at Thessalonica. The two earliest of the
Pauline Epistles—supposed to have been written in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 52 and 53—are
largely taken up with the exhibition and refutation of the departures
from the Catholic doctrine on this subject.</p>

<p>After their experience at Philippi, Paul and Silas passed on through
Amphipolis and Apollonia to Thessalonica. This city—now called in
slightly changed form Salonica—was a great maritime city and the
capital of the first division of Macedonia, and it always had a large
Jewish population. As Antioch was the natural center for Christian
work in Asia Minor, so Thessalonica was one of the best strategic points—if
not the best—for beginning the conquest of Europe. This was
recognized by Paul himself, who, inspired with the great purpose of
making the empire of Christ coterminous with that of Rome, wrote,
only a few months after leaving Thessalonica (1 Thess. i. 8), that “from
them the word of the Lord had sounded forth like a trumpet, not only
in Macedonia and Achaia, but <em>in every place</em>.”</p>

<p>The preaching that led to the expulsion of Paul and Silas from the
city (see Acts xvii. 1-10) furnishes the key to the Epistles written a
little later. It was the doctrine of the <em>Kingdom of God</em>. The accusation
brought against them was that they were proclaiming <em>another King</em>
than Cæsar (Acts xvii. 7). In writing to them Paul accordingly reminds
them of his exhortations and entreaties, that they should “walk
worthy of God who called them to his <em>Kingdom</em> and Glory” (1 Thess.
ii. 12), and addresses them as those who had “suffered affliction for the
sake of that <em>Kingdom</em>” (2 Thess. i. 5). Christ’s <em>Second Coming</em> had
evidently been a chief topic of Paul’s preaching to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span></p>

<p>The brevity of the Apostle’s stay in the city gave little opportunity
for instructing and grounding the Christians, chiefly Gentiles, in the
Christian system; but they appear to have continued stedfast in the
faith in the severe persecutions and afflictions that followed (1 Thess.
ii. 14; iii. 3; 2 Thess. i. 4). Nevertheless there were some peculiar
aspects of the doctrine of the Second Coming toward which their trials
seemed naturally to push them. Looking upon it as the glorious <em>coming
of the Lord for deliverance</em> (1 Thess. i. 10), some came to believe in
the <em>imminency</em>, if not the <em>immediacy</em>, of the Second Advent; and so gave
up laboring for their own support, became burdensome to the brethren,
and encouraged irregularities by their mode of life. Moreover, there
arose a perplexity about the case of those who should fall asleep before
the Second Coming.</p>

<p>This state of things led Paul, toward the close of 53 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, to write
from Athens his <cite>First Epistle</cite> to the Thessalonians, to give specific instruction
regarding these points. His main theme is the <em>consolation
from the hope of the Second Coming of the Lord</em>. The leading words in
the Epistle (as in 2 Thessalonians) are <em>Parousia</em> (advent, or appearing)
and <em>Affliction</em>. The prominence in it of the coming of the Lord is
shown by the fact that each chapter rises to and rests in that Coming as
its conclusion (see ch. i. 10; ii. 20; iii. 13; iv. 17, 18; v. 23).</p>

<p>The <cite>Second Epistle</cite> was written to the Thessalonians in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 53, from
Corinth. The former letter had produced salutary results, on which the
Apostle congratulates them; but their manifold tribulations on account
of the faith had caused the opinion that the Lord’s coming would take
place immediately, to gain ground rapidly among them. This hope
was fostered by some among them who claimed to have the “spirit of
prophecy,” and it was also thought to be favored by Paul’s own teachings
(2 Thess. ii. 2). In consequence of this, the habits of idleness and
irregularity had increased. Moreover, the false Jewish teachers were
beginning to lead the Thessalonian Christians to look upon “the Day
of the Lord,” according to the Old-Testament view (Isa. xiii.; Joel ii.;
Amos v. 18), as <em>a Day of Judgment</em>, rather than of deliverance and glory.
The aim of the <cite>Second Epistle</cite> is to meet the new needs that had
arisen.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this outline view that the Epistles to the Thessalonians
bear a relation to the Second Advent of Christ similar to that
of the Book of Daniel to his First Advent. They were the guidebook
for that age and for the Church of the after-ages. In conjunction with
the teaching of our Lord Himself in Matt. xxiv., their instructions and
directions would appear to be sufficiently full and explicit. For the
time being the Chiliastic views seem to have disappeared from the
Church, and the Catholic doctrine to have held full sway.</p>

<p>A new development of Chiliasm took place toward the close of the
second century. It resulted from the persecuting hand of the government
being laid heavily upon the Church.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to enter into the causes of the persecutions by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
the Romans. It is enough to note that the ideas of religious freedom in
the modern world are quite alien to those of the ancient world. There
were none but state religions and national gods. Cicero lays down as
the fundamental maxim of legislation in ancient Romanism, that “no
man shall have for himself particular gods of his own; no man shall
worship by himself any new or foreign gods, unless they are recognized
by the public laws.” And so Christianity came necessarily into collision
with the laws of the state.</p>

<p>The bloody persecutions, from the last half of the second century onward,
were the inevitable outcome of this natural and essential antagonism;
but even in the opening half of the second century the Christians
were subjected to sore trials such as those from which the Thessalonians
suffered. In passing through these, their minds seem to have turned
again, says Neander, to “the idea of the millennial reign, which the
Messiah was to set up on earth.… In the midst of persecutions, it
was a solace and support to the Christians to anticipate that even upon
this earth, the scene of their sufferings, the Church was destined to triumph
in its perfected and glorified state.” In some regions this view
took on a more spiritual form; while in others, as in Phrygia, the natural
home of a sensual, enthusiastic religious spirit, “Chiliasm appeared
in its crass and grossly conceived form in which the earthly Jewish
mind had depicted it.”</p>

<p>Among the Apostolic Fathers, in the second century, the doctrine
appears in the writings of Barnabas, Hernias, and Papias, Bishop of
Hierapolis, only, the last named teaching it in its grossest form. As
Dr. Shedd has said (“History of Christian Doctrine,” vol. ii., p. 390):
“There are no traces of Chiliasm in the writings of Clement of Rome,
Ignatius, Polycarp, Tatian, Athenagorus, and Theophilus of Antioch.”
He adds: “The inference from these facts, then, is that this tenet was
not the received faith of the Church certainly down to the year 150. It
was held only by individuals.” Among the really masterful scholars,
ecclesiastics, and theologians, it had not a single advocate. That it
was not the faith of the Apostolic Church is further evident from the
fact that it was not embodied in the so-called Apostles’ Creed, which is
“undoubtedly the substance of the short confessions of faith which the
catechumens of the Apostolic Church were accustomed to make upon
entering the Church.”</p>

<p>The period from 150 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> to 250 has been called “the blooming age of
Millenarianism.” It was in this period of bitter and increased persecution
that Irenæus and Tertullian came forward as its advocates, giving
glowing descriptions of the millennial reign. “Antichrist, together
with all the nations that side with him, will be destroyed. All earthly
empires, and the Roman in particular, will be overthrown. Christ will
appear, and will reign a thousand years, in corporeal presence on earth,
in Jerusalem, which will be rebuilt and made the capital of His kingdom.
The patriarchs, prophets, and all the pious, will be raised from
the dead, and share in the felicity of this kingdom. The New Jerusalem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
is depicted in the most splendid colors” (Shedd, “History of Christian
Doctrine,” vol. ii.. p. 390).</p>

<p>But even Irenæus and Tertullian, in presenting “brief synoptical
statements of the authorized faith of the Church,” in their writings
against heretics, make no mention of the Millenarian tenet as belonging
to that faith.</p>

<p>The third century, chiefly in its first half, witnessed the strenuous
discussion that seems practically to have brought to an end, for the
time at least, the tendency in the Church to accept the Chiliastic doctrine.
This was conducted in the Alexandrian School, under the lead
of three great teachers, Clement of Alexandria, Origen his pupil, and
Dionysius the pupil of Origen. They did not reject the Apocalypse,
but addressed themselves to opposing the grossly literal interpretations
put upon it by the Chiliasts.</p>

<p>The method adopted by Bishop Dionysius of Alexandria is of peculiar
interest, as showing what may be accomplished by candid Christian
discussion. Neander gives a somewhat detailed account of his course
(“Church History,” vol. i., p. 452). Nepos, a pious Egyptian bishop
belonging to the region of Arsinoë, and who was a devoted friend of the
sensual Chiliasm, wrote a book against the Alexandrian school, entitled
“A Refutation of the Allegorists.” “The book seems to have found
great favor with the clergy and laity in the above-mentioned district.
Great mysteries and disclosures of future events were supposed to be
found here; and many engaged with more zeal in the study of the book
and theory of Nepos than in that of the Bible and its doctrines.” So
zealous did his disciples become for this tenet that they brought the
charge of heresy against all who refused to accept it. Whole churches
separated themselves from their communion with the mother-church at
Alexandria. After the death of Nepos, a country priest, Coracion, took
the leadership of this party.</p>

<p>Neander gives an interesting account of the way in which, by instruction
and discussion, the good and wise Bishop of Alexandria, Dionysius,
led Coracion back to the faith. This happened in the year 255.</p>

<p>“Having restored the unity of faith among his own churches,” Dionysius
wrote his work on the Promises, for the instruction of the churches.
By the opening of the fourth century Chiliasm seems to have almost
disappeared from the Church, as is shown by the statements of Eusebius,
the church historian. Describing the writings of Papias, Eusebius
remarks that they contain “matters rather too fabulous,” among which
he enumerates the opinion of Papias that “there would be a certain
millennium after the resurrection, and that there would be a corporeal
reign of Christ on this very earth.” The return to the Catholic doctrine
on the subject seems therefore to have been quite general before
the year 400.</p>

<p>The history of the Chiliastic doctrine from the opening of the fifth
century may be briefly summarized, since its manifestations have been
only sporadic and temporary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span></p>

<p>As the tenth century drew to a close there arose “an undefined fear
and expectation among the masses that the year 1000 would witness the
advent of the Lord,” but this passed away with the century.</p>

<p>At the time of the Reformation, the doctrine was revived by the
fanatical Anabaptists, Münzer and his followers, who attempted to put
down all temporal sovereignty and to establish the kingdom of the saints
with fire and sword. They were, however, vigorously opposed by Luther,
Melancthon, Calvin, and the other great reformers, and their military
forces were defeated and crushed and their leaders slain at Mühlhausen
in 1525 and at Munster in 1535. Leading symbols of the Reformation
period strongly condemn Chiliasm, <i>e.g.</i>, the Augsburg Confession, the
Belgic Confession, and the English Confession of Edward VI.</p>

<p>The history of the doctrine during the nineteenth century is well
summarized by Dr. Shedd:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the present century, individual minds in England and
America, and upon the Continent of Europe, have attempted to revive
the theory—in some instances in union with an intelligent and earnest
orthodoxy, in others in connection with an uneducated and somewhat
fanatical pietism. The first class is represented by Delitzsch and Auberlen
in Germany, and by Cumming, Elliott, and Bonar in Great
Britain; the second class by the so-called Adventists and Millerites in
the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Millerite movement, started in 1831 by William Miller, an American,
who predicted that Christ’s Second Coming and the end of the
world would take place in 1843, received what was practically its death-blow
in the failure of the prediction to meet with accomplishment at
the appointed time. Substantially the same classes of people are, however,
to be found among the Adventists, or Second Adventists, of the
present time, including a considerable number of immigrant foreigners,
especially Scandinavians. Some of these hold to the doctrine of the
annihilation of the wicked and to that of the sleep of the dead until the
resurrection. The approach of the twentieth century seems to have
given an impulse to the Adventist movement, altho it has not changed
the character or quality of its advocates.</p>

<p>The survey thus made of the history of the Church, ancient, medieval,
and modern, brings out the fact that the <em>Catholic</em> doctrine, as already
outlined, has always been the Church doctrine. The <em>Chiliastic</em> views
based upon the literal interpretation of the Scriptures bearing upon the
subject have never been generally accepted. The facts, as summarized
by Dr. Shedd (“History of Christian Doctrine,” vol. ii., p. 398), are as
follows:</p>

<p>“1. That Millenarianism was never the ecumenical faith of the
Church and never entered as an article into any of the creeds.</p>

<p>“2. That Millenarianism has been the opinion of individuals and
parties only—some of whom have stood in agreement with the Catholic
faith, and some in opposition to it.”</p>

<h3 id="REASONS">REASONS FOR THE BELIEF THAT CHRIST MAY
COME WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS</h3>

<p class="by">By ARTHUR T. PIERSON, D.D.</p>

<p>Is the day of Christ near at hand?</p>

<p>This question is attracting much attention as this new century begins,
and wise men are watching for the morning star, which is the herald of
the new dawn.</p>

<p>Imminence is a word used for the union of the <em>certainty of an event
with the uncertainty of its time</em>. One text suffices to show that such imminence
is, in the Scripture, characteristic of the Lord’s return: “Be ye
also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh”
(Matt, xxiv. 44). Such an exhortation excludes mere argument.
The certainty of the event is assured, for “the Son of Man cometh;” the
uncertainty of the time is conceded, for it is “in an hour that ye think
not” or as verse 36 adds, “of that day and hour knoweth no man.”</p>

<p>In a broader sense, the word imminent is used to express the idea
that the event is <em>impending</em>—nigh at hand. True, it may be unwise to
attempt to fix the very “day and hour,” since these are declared to lie
among the divine secrets. Yet it may be both possible and proper to
observe carefully the signs which are to precede or accompany Christ’s
reappearing, and even the mistakes of those who have made erroneous
calculations as to the time may serve only to narrow the circle within
which the truth is to be found. We shall therefore inquire briefly
whether there is any reason to look for the speedy reappearing of the
Son of Man, and, without committing ourselves to all the opinions
which follow, we may state the grounds on which such conclusions
have been reached by many devout students of the subject.</p>

<p>The appeal must, of course, be to the Holy Oracles, if we are to get
any safe response. Seven signs hinted at in the Word of God may be
selected, as prominent:</p>

<p>(1) A widespread witness to Christ, with (2) a widespread decline
in godliness. (3) A marked movement among the Jews, with (4) the
fulness of the Gentiles. (5) A singularly unresting state of society,
with (6) a daring development of iniquity and (7) a confident sense of
false security. These seven indications must be studied in the light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
seven conspicuous passages of Scripture, such as Matt, xxiv., Luke xxi.,
Rom. xi., 2 Thess. ii., 2 Peter iii., 2 Tim. iii., and Jude.</p>

<p>It may be well to add that, if such conclusion hung upon any one of
these signs alone, it might be more than doubtful; but, when all these
unite, they serve as far safer guides; as a cable may be unbreakable, any
one of whose separate strands would easily part under severe tension.</p>

<p>Thoughtful observers of events, who are at the same time prayerful
students of Scripture, have come to feel that there is a manifold and remarkable
preparation for the “Parousia” or personal coming of Christ;
and that the existing state of both the church and the world seems to
demand His coming as the only solution of the problems of prophecy
and of history.</p>

<p>The present drift of society is toward <em>anarchy</em>, a drift that has been
peculiarly rapid during the last quarter-century. Socialism, communism,
nihilism, and the hot battle between capital and labor, monopoly
and poverty, are the dominant facts and forces in this war, now being
waged, with increasing violence and desperateness, against all government.
There is also a strong drift in the church toward <em>apostasy</em>.
Witness the advance of Romanism, ritualism, and rationalism, even in
Protestant churches and communities. In society at large there is a
corresponding advance of materialism, agnosticism, and infidelity; and
the polite disguises of science, culture, and criticism do not hide the
true features and forms which they clothe, but can not conceal.</p>

<p>Who can fail to see the trend of the Jews toward national rehabilitation
and the colonization of Palestine, while at the same time the church
is fettered by secularism on the one hand and skepticism on the other?
Side by side with these signs there is the opening of the world to the
Gospel, the world-wide circulation of the Bible in over four hundred
tongues, the network of missionary societies wrapping the globe, and
the uprising of Christian young men and women in an unparalleled crusade
of missions. All these are like fingers all pointing in one direction—the
Sunrise of the Ages.</p>

<p>Many other Scriptures, besides those already cited, startle us from our
apathy, especially when we compare them. Take, for example, Matt,
xiii. and Rev. ii.-iii. The seven parables in the former and the seven
letters to the churches in the latter appear to correspond chronologically.
In Matthew, the last scene shows the <em>dragnet</em>—the obvious metaphor for
world-wide evangelization. In the Apocalypse, the last rebuke is to
<em>Laodicea</em>—the self-deceived and self-sufficient church, that shuts in
worldliness and shuts out Christ. When in history did those two conditions
ever meet as they do now? On one hand a wealthy, self-satisfied,
lukewarm Christianity, and on the other a casting of the Gospel net into
the world sea, and gathering of every kind of fish! For the first time in
this gospel age, ecclesiastical degeneracy and evangelistic activity curiously
blending—fulfilling before our eyes our Lord’s paradox—world-wide
witness side by side with love waxing cold!</p>

<p>One remark may be added as to the “times of the Gentiles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a remarkable consensus of opinion that it is from Nebuchadnezzar—the
world king and head of gold—that the “times of the gentiles”
date. His time was about 600 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> If the “seven times” or seven
years, of Dan. iv. 25, represent, as is supposed, seven periods of 360
years each (or seven times twelve months of thirty year-days), then the
full seven times from Nebuchadnezzar to the end would be 2,520 years,
and reckoning from 600 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> this brings us to 1920 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, or thereabouts.
These 2,520 years appear to be divided into two exactly equal periods
of 1,260 years each, or “forty and two months,” or “a time, times and
half a time” (<i>i.e.</i>, three and a half of these prophetic years) (Rev. xi. 2,
3., and xii. 14).</p>

<p>As to the filling up of the 1,260 days of the latter half, the historic
correspondences are so remarkable that at least ten different methods of
computation seem to point to the same precise period—an interval of
time lying somewhere between 1880 and 1920, the uncertainty of the
exact time of the end resulting from the difficulty of fixing the exact
date of the beginning. But it is this convergence of prophetic and historic
times at some point within these forty years which has awakened
such a widespread interest in the imminence of our Lord’s coming.
And, surely, as our Lord has taught us, if it behooves us to observe the
signs of the weather, we should not be indifferent to the signs on God’s
greater horizon, which to watchful souls indicate the approach of the
day of the Lord (Matt. xvi. 1-3).</p>

<p>Upon the ten different methods of computation referred to above, it
may be well to expand a little, without committing oneself to the positions
taken. No one, however, can appreciate the argument, whatever be
its worth, who does not understand the <em>numerical system</em> which manifestly
pervades the whole Word of God, and which constitutes a sort of
mathematical framework upon which the whole written Revelation is
constructed; and not only so, but this same numerical structure pervades
also all the works of God in Creation, and all the workings of God in
human history. Astronomy, chemistry, botany, biology, theology, all
obey one mathematical law, and it must be a prejudiced mind that refuses
to recognize this fact. The orbits of the planets and the spiral
course of the leaf-buds on the trees, the proportions and dimensions of
crystals, the octaves of sound and of color—these and many other operations,
forces and forms of nature conform to strict mathematical laws.
From Sirius down to the invisible atom there is a uniform system, and
it tells of the one Designer and Creator. Once let this fact be admitted
and it becomes no novelty to us to find evidences of similar mathematical
precision in the periods of history. Let us, therefore, in conclusion,
glance at the various positions taken by devout students of history and
prophecy, and impartially survey the outlook from their points of view.</p>

<p>1. The first method of computation, already referred to, as fixing the
present period as approximately “the time of the end” is known as “the
times of the Gentiles,” seven times, or years, each consisting of 360 year-days,
or a sum-total of 2,620 years. Of this period, Professor Totten, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
New Haven, following the lead of the British Chronological Association,
says:</p>

<p>“Nabopolassar shook off the yoke of Assyria, and, by thus assuming
the crown of Babylon, commenced the ‘times of the Gentiles.’ His
accession took place in the seventh civil (first sacred) month of the year
3377 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> The ‘times of the Gentiles’ therefore ran out 2,520 years
thereafter, or in March, 5897 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1899).”</p>

<p>Thus by another method of computing the times of the Gentiles, he
arrives at the present period as at least the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>“Joshua’s Long Day was the last day in broad prophetic chronology
which is to be wholly counted as <em>solar</em> time. Since that day, the millenaries
have been ‘shortened’ to <em>lunar</em> years. The sum of the 2,555¼+
‘long’ or solar years up to that day, and the 3,444¾+ ‘shortened’ or
lunar years, from thence to the vernal equinox of 1899 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, is exactly
6,000, and accurately terminates the sixth millennary since creation.”</p>

<p>2. Secondly, the <em>Sabbatic system</em>, impressed on the whole face of
Scripture history, affords, as many think, a very obvious key to the divine
chronology. This Sabbatic system reaches back to Eden and characterizes
the whole annals of the world. There was first consecrated the
seventh <em>day</em>, then the seventh <em>week</em>, then the seventh <em>month</em>, then the
seventh <em>year</em>, then the seventh <em>seven</em> of years—introducing the “jubilee”—then
the seventh <em>seventy</em> of years, the Grand Jubilee. This number
7 × 70, or 490, appears in at least two conspicuous places, 1 Kings vi. 1,
where, adding the ten years of the temple building to the 480, between
the exodus and the beginning of the work, we have 490; and, in Daniel
ix. 24, where again the seven sevens reappear, as the sacred typical
number, between the exodus from the captivity and the building of the
new spiritual temple of God under the Messiah. This number 490 is
doubly a type of completeness: it is not only the product of 7 multiplied
by 70, but of 7 times 7 (49), the interval from jubilee to jubilee,
multiplied by 10—another sacred number. These jubilee periods must
be obviously reckoned from the time of <em>Moses</em>, when the law of the jubilee
first appears. And, counting the exodus from 2515 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, the full
seven periods of 490, or 3,430 years, would bring us to 5945 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, or somewhere
this side of the middle of the next century as its extreme limit;
and, if the years are to be reckoned by the <em>prophetic-year</em> standard of 360
days (twelve equal months of thirty days each) the limit would be somewhere
about 1898, so that by this method again the “beginning of the
end” has already come.</p>

<p>3. A third method of computation, “<em>The Millennial Standard</em>,” is
thought to point to the same approximate terminus. “One day is with
the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day” (2 Peter
iii. 8). This is regarded by many as another not very obscure hint as
to God’s chronology, and they therefore reason that the predicted millennium
or thousand years of Sabbatic rest, crowning the six millenniums
of a world’s toil, can not be far off.</p>

<p>4. The fourth method of computation is “<em>the historical</em>.” The number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
1,260 (“forty-two months,” “a time, times, and half a time”) is as
we have already seen, conspicuous both in Daniel and in Revelation.</p>

<p>Those who accept the “historical” method of interpreting the Apocalypse
believe that the beast and the false prophet represent the Papacy
and Mohammedanism, or the crucifix and the crescent. They maintain
that it is a curious fact, to say the least, that both these systems date
from the period between 606 and 620 (the decree of Phocas and the first
Hegira) as the <i lang="la">terminus a quo</i>, and, adding 1,260, they reach again a <i lang="la">terminus
ad quem</i> somewhere between 1866 and 1886 as “the beginning of
the end” of these systems, as world powers or kingdoms.</p>

<p>5. A fifth mode of computation is that of the “<em>Antichrist Period</em>.”
The number, 666, is divinely given as the number of the <em>lawless one</em>
(ὁ ἀνομος, ὁ ἀναρχος) who is to be revealed in the last week of years. This
number, thus inseparably linked with the man of sin, in whom personally
all the Antichristian systems of history are to “head up,” is thought by
many to stand for the period of the race’s rebellion, and to be the symbolic
number of perpetual unrest and incompleteness. There is a show
of reason in this, for 666 is a repeating decimal that ever approaches, but
never reaches, <em>seven</em>, the number of completeness and rest. Six times
this number 666 gives 3,996, the grand crisis—the year of Christ’s birth,
reckoning from creation; and again, reckoning from Abraham’s birth, as
father of the faithful, brings us to the beginning of this century as a
new crisis in history.</p>

<p>6. A sixth road by which the same terminus is reached is the “condition
of <em>world-witness</em>” (see Matt, xxiv. 14, Mark xiii. 10). Christ
distinctly stated that the Gospel must first be published among all nations,
and preached as a witness to all nations, and then would come the
<span class="smcapuc">END</span>. With no little force many argue that there never was a period of
such world-wide evangelism as now. Over three hundred missionary
societies at work, about twelve thousand missionary workers, and nearly
fifty thousand native helpers, engaged; the Bible translated into over
four hundred tongues, etc., and “published to all nations.” It is also
very noticeable that the motto of the present“crusade” is “The evangelization
of the world in this generation!”</p>

<p>7. A seventh mode of computing is that of the <em>Laodicean lukewarmness</em>.
By a comparison of Matt. xiii. 47-50 and Rev. iii. 14-22, it will
be seen that the last state of the “<em>kingdom</em>,” previous to the end, is world-wide
evangelism, as indicated by the dragnet; and the last state of the
<em>church</em> is deep-seated apathy, as indicated by the Laodicean lukewarmness.
And those who hold this view contend that both conditions are
to coexist as the end draws nigh. They point us to the startling fact that
<em>never before</em> has the church shown signs of such extensive evangelization
on the one hand, and such extensive deterioration on the other. Many
regard this latter as the “falling away,” which is to precede the end (2
Thess. ii. 3).</p>

<p>8. An eighth road seems to end at the same goal—it is the <em>development
of anarchism</em>. The hints in the Epistles to the Thessalonians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
2 Peter, Jude, and the Apocalypse, it is contended, all agree in showing
us that, as the end approaches, there will be a peculiarly lawless
spirit prevailing—an uprising of an organized resistance to all authority
in church and state, a combination of forces to supplant all government,
and at the same time an arbitrary attempt to compel men to limit
even trade and commerce by a certain “mark,” that alone authorizes one
to “buy or sell” (Rev. xiii. 16, 17). Those who emphasize this as a sign
of the end point triumphantly to the recent and unprecedented growth
of communism, socialism, and nihilism; and to the simultaneous
growth of trades-unions and protective organizations, monopolies and
trusts, which restrict all trade or labor to their “mark.”</p>

<p>9. The ninth argument presented for the near approach of the end is
<em>Irredentism</em> or the drift of the Jews toward Palestine, and the rehabilitation
of their national life. This is, as the advocates of this view contend,
“the blossoming of the fig-tree” (Matt. xxiv. 32, 33), which marks
the end as “near, even at the doors.” Certainly there is something very
startling in the modern movement known as “Zionism,” and which has
developed within the last five years, summoning these great conferences
of leading Jews to the European capitals. Never before has the national
spirit of the Israelites had such a revival since Christ ascended.</p>

<p>10. The tenth line of argument converges at the same point, namely,
the <em>Spirit’s withdrawal</em>. There is a mysterious passage in 2 Thess. ii. 7,
where we are told that there is some great Hinderer, whose presence
prevents the final outbreak of the Mystery of Iniquity, and who must be
withdrawn before the end of lawlessness can come, in the “reappearing
of the Lord.” The advocates of this view contend that, by every sign, the
Spirit of God is shown to have withdrawn or to be withdrawing from
the church as a whole. It is maintained by very devout souls that
there is left, in the church at large, neither spiritual worship, spiritual
faith, spiritual work, nor spiritual life; that altho these all exist, they
exist in a few elect individuals, and not in the church as a body; and
that, especially in the matter of <em>administration</em>—the specific office of
the Spirit—He is displaced by the spirit of the world, as evinced by
the worldly men and maxims, secular oratory, artistic music, worldly
entertainments, etc., which everywhere prevail.</p>

<p>Whatever grounds, above presented, may seem untenable or unsafe,
one thing seems undeniable: there is a <em>convergence of signs upon this our
day</em>, such as has never indicated any previous period as the probable
time of the end. For example, if the Hebrew means <em>Rosh</em>, Russia, and
this nation is thus in prophecy indicated as the “head” of the last great
movement of history toward world empire, how like a fulfilment are
all the present movements of that empire—the trans-Siberian railway,
the encroachments on China, etc.! And if universal anarchy is to be
the last great development of society, when was there a time when, both
in church and state, there was such a development of lawlessness
(ἀνομια)?</p>

<p>Upon this subject we can no longer, within these narrow limits, expatiate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
But it may at least stir up the thoughtful reader to individual
search into the signs of the times. What are the indications above the
prophetic and historic horizon? If the signs of the coming of the Son
of Man are indeed to be seen, it may well incite us to be among the
watchers who, while others yet sleep, are awake and looking for the
dawn!</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
